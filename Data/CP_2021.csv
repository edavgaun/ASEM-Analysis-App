0,FACTORS AFFECTING SAFETY CULTURE: WHAT’S MISSING?,@oregonstate.edu,"Safety culture, systematic perspective, dynamic nature of culture, national culture, generational differences, intermural","Since the Chernobyl Disaster, the concept of safety culture has been extensively explored in an effort to study and improve an organization’s safety performance through monitoring a nd controlling certain factors within the organization’s safety culture. As cited in the literature, the main factors of safety culture include  organizational and management commitment, organizational and management involvement, employee engagement an d empowerment, rewards systems, and reporting systems. Although these factors may determine aspects of a safety culture, they have been presented and examined as snapshots of the culture; they do not emphasize or account for the slow, but constantly changing dynamic nature of culture. The safety culture, however slow to change, changes over time due to technological advancement and its associated effect on the organization’s operations , and highly influential events such as pandemics or other large scale industrial accidents . This paper argues that although the current research on safety culture and models highlights some factors of safety culture, it lacks the ability to capture and reflect the dynamic change that is happening . The aim of this paper is to  propose a systematic perspective of viewing safety culture such that it captures and reflects the dynamic changes observed in organizational safety c ulture. To highlight safety culture’s dynamic nature, other factors which may  be incorporated into  the safety culture literature for this current time are highlighted. Five factors are identified : staffing alignment and integration, utilization of big data  in productivity and employee surveillance, effect of national culture, variation in generations, and intermural knowledge sharing. Keywords Safety culture, systematic perspective, dynamic nature of culture, national culture, generational differences, intermural knowledge sharing. Introduction Safety culture is a term that has taken different definitions due to differences in research backgrounds and perspectives (Wiegmann et al., 2004). In their report on safety culture, the International Atomic Energ y Agency (IAEA) defines safety culture as “that assembly of characteristics and attitudes in organizations and individuals which establishes that, as an overriding priority, (nuclear plant) safety issues receive the attention warranted by their significanc e.” (IAEA, 1992, p.04). Factors that influence organizational and individual characters and attitudes towards safety have been studied by different researchers. Appendix A presents the factors of safety culture as defined by 25 studies that were found in t he literature. Although all 2 5 works highlight different factors that influence safety culture, most of the highlighted factors fall under seven categories –  management and organizational commitment and involvement in safety, employee behaviors and commitment towards safety, reward systems, report systems, communication, just culture, and employee empowerment and responsibility While these factors may form and describe safety culture, they do so limitedly. . Cultural change is not drastic or sudden; however, culture is dynamic. Cultural change is a slow process but may be accelerated by disruptive ev ents such as technological advancements, drastic change due to large scale events, or change in national culture  (Wesch,",oregonstate.edu,Oregon State University,United States,44.56305595,-123.28392337694638
1,STRUCTURED METHOD FOR SELECTION OF STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE FOR THE U.S. NAVY’S SAIL TRAINING CRAFT,@nps.edu,"Acquisition management, program management, stakeholder management, stakeholder engagement","Historically, acquisitions of sail training craft (STC) at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) have been over cost and schedule. A review of past acquisitions, revealed that an effective stakeholder management plan could be a possible solution. This paper outlines use of System Engineer Management techniques to frame the problem and help the USNA select a tool to support development and execution of an effective stakeholder management plan for the acquisition of the next generation STC. Utilizing data an alysis techniques, four essential elements to any stakeholder management plan emerged: identify, analyze, engage, and monitor.   Next, measures of performance relative to these essential elements were developed. Eleven commercially available stakeholder man agement techniques were evaluated relative to the essential elements and measures of performance using a morphological box. Ultimately, the Stakeholder Circle technique was selected because it was able to address all four essential elements and best addressed the measures of performance that the STC program office valued most. A crosswalk, between the objectives hierarchy and elements of the morphological box was used to validate that the selected technique addressed the need. If effectively implemented, th e resulting stakeholder management plan could support timely and cost -effective acquisition of the next-generation STC. This work specifically contributes to engineering management by outlining a structured method for selection of a stakeholder management technique to manage for results in a specific context. Future research could include the development of structural stakeholder management elements, improving stakeholder management requirements elicitation, and developing stakeholder management plan valida tion methods. Keywords Acquisition management, program management, stakeholder management, stakeholder engagement Introduction Historically, the acquisition of the Sail Training Craft (STC) at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) has been challenging due to an extensive list of disparate stakeholders, unique requirements, and its multi-purpose use as both a training and a racing  craft. The STC is a relatively simple craft, yet has no fewer than 11 identified formal and informal stakeholders, representing both government, public, and private interest (T. Green e, email, April 23, 2020). In addition to competing interests from multiple stakeholders, the STC remains subject to the federal acquisitions process. During the summer of 2019, the USNA began producing requirements for the third generation of the STC, and problems reminiscent of previous acquisitions reveal ed themselves. It is believed that a formal and properly executed stakeholder management plan could help minimize some of these problems.",nps.edu,Naval Postgraduate School,United States,36.598,-121.875
2,FACE-TO-FACE VERSUS VIRTUAL TRAINING: CAPTURING STUDENTS’ VOICE,@utsouthwestern.edu,"Teamwork, Interprofessional, Health, Education, Qualitative Data, Thematic Analysis.","“Introduction to Teamwork” (ITT) is the first module in the longitudinal curriculum of Team FIRST, an institutionally sponsored quality enhancement plan dedicated to expanding and improving teamwork competencies for health professions and medical students at UT Southwestern. ITT includes multiple interprofessional activities which occurs yearly at a face -to-face gathering. However, due to the limitations caused by COVID -19, this large-scale event was moved to a virtual platform. Although some of the activities were easily adapted to the vi rtual format, others had to be redesigned completely. Implementing these changes in the three  months leading up to the event posed significant challenges. This study aimed to compare students’ feedback in two consecutive years of ITT using Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA). A focus group study was completed to collect student feedback on ITT 2019. For ITT 2020, students’ feedback was collected using a digital survey. According to the QDA, nine  themes were identified including: preparation, organization, techn ology, instruction, facilitators, time, format, learning content, and team dynamics. While seven of these themes were common in both years, technology and format only appeared in ITT 2020 with several comments related to the platform used (Zoom). The majority of the comments received for ITT 2019 pertained to preparation (36%), facilitators (21%), and learning content (20%). In ITT 2020, however, most comments were focused on learning content (26%), technology and facilitators (14% each), and time (12%). Re sults of this study can be utilized by other academic organizations planning to translate established learning modules to a virtual platform . Keywords Teamwork, Interprofessional, Health, Education, Qualitative Data, Thematic Analysis. Introduction A critical step in medical school accreditation includes review by The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) or similar accrediting body. SACSCOC requires its accredited institutions to undergo a comprehensive decennial review to ensure that each institution continues to meet member-driven standards of quality, which UT Southwestern medical center satisfies through our 2019 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) implementation, known as Team FIRST. Team FIRST is dedicated to expanding and improving teamwork training for medical and health professions students at UT Southwestern. Its curriculum consists of five learning modules that progressively build upon each other to teach teamwork competencies  effectively and efficiently. The first module in this longitudinal curriculum is called “Introduction to Teamwork”. “Introduction to Teamwork” (ITT), historically known as Convergence, is the largest interprofessional event at UT Southwestern (>800 student participants). First year medical and other health profession students (including nursing, pharmacy, occupational therapy, public health, etc.) from other regional schools (such as UT Arlington, Texas Women’s University, Texas Tech University, etc.) participate in this event every year. The main goal of this module is to teach students the importance of team -based communication and tools that increase the reliability of information transfer between health care providers. Four learning outcomes are expected from student participants: 1 - Know the roles and responsibilities of team members and teams; 2 - Describe the criticality of team-based communication; 3- Identify why a structured approach to communicati on during handovers is important; and 4 - Demonstrate closed -loop communication ( Hargestam et al., 2013 ).

There is not much work done in the nuclear industry sector that focuses on qualitative and quantitative analysis to identify the industry’s core competence and external threats, especially at a local industry level. In t his study, an internal analysis was performed using a quantitative approach as a first step followed by a qualitative approach was used to capture the general public’s knowledge of the sector in the United States. Internal data from a local nuclear plant was used for internal analysis while a questionnaire was used to study public understanding or perception.

Keywords Nuclear, clean energy, CO2 emission, energy demand, fission. Introduction Industrialization and globalization over the last century has had remarkable benefits to our quality of life. It has made goods more affordable and accessible, contributed to the evolution of medicine, and connected us with cultures around the world (Johnson, 2002; Evans, Patridarion, &  Lambert, 2007; Rafferty, n.a.) . The g lobal economic growth is directly tied to the development of manufacturing, combustion engines, and electric- power lines, among others. At the ceterpiece of f ueling this growth and improvement in our lives is energy generation. Energy in the form of electricity is crucial in achieving sustainable development. Hence, electrical energy consumption and demand has increased continuously over the past hundred years , as electricity has become a necessity to our daily lives and in a way, to our survival. The global electricity demand is projected to nearly double in the next 30 years (Eule, 2018) . As the need and dependence on electricity continues to grow, it is important to understand where this energy comes from. This is important because energy sources have advantages and disadvantages, and some have irreversible adverse effects to our lives and future generations. There is a wide variety of electricity generating sources, ranging from hydropo wer as one of the oldest, to solar and wind, which are more recent in development. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the three major categories of sources for electricity are fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum), nuclear energy, and renewables like hydro and wind, among others (EIA, 2019). Annual report data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), show n in Exhibit 1, indicated that of the above energy sources, coal has been the leading contributor throughout history. Coal amounts to roughly 38% of worldwide gross electricity production, followed by natural gas at nearly 23%, and hydropower around 16% (IEA, 2019) . This breakdown is alarming because it shows that over 60% of the electricity generated comes from burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels as energy source has its advantages, like being well developed, cheap, and reliable (Gaille, 2017). A major disadvantage is the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Global carbon emissions have increased at an  alarming rate since the mid -20th century. Industrial activities and transportation are major contributors to these emissions. However, electricity generation accounts to 40% of the total amount of carbon dioxide  emissions (IEA, 2019) . The accumulation of these gases in our atmosphere has adverse effects on climate. Continuing to generate electricity from 60% fossil fuels is not a sustainable solution, especially when the demand for energy will continue to grow.

4,ENGINEERING QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS,@astate.edu,"Quality, Construction industry, Quality Management System (QMS), Quality control (QC), Quality assurance (QA),","Managing high quality each phase in the project is never an easy process which can easily be controlled in most of the construction projects. Managing quality requires awareness and full attention to the system as a whole during each process. The objective of this paper is to identify the relative importance of a quality management system and the factors that could affect it, especially in construction. It is important as it saves a lot of time, money, and resources each year because of the inefficient or n on-existing quality levels. A quality management system is used to achieve many goals, and one of the most important goals is ensuring that customer expectations are met, if not exceeded, while minimizing costs. Quality management of construction projects is the most significant part of project management. This paper will show the factors that could affect construction qualities, as well as the characteristics of construction quality information. Keywords Quality, Construction industry, Quality Management System (QMS), Quality control (QC), Quality assurance (QA), Engineering Management (EM). Introduction Sochell (2014) noted that a basis for quality management and analysis is given by the definition of the method. Before creating a system for quality preparation and analysis, it will be important to define the quality definition. In a variety of ways, numerous authors have defined ""quality."" Crosby (1979 and 1984) regarded quality as ""conforming to the specification."" In other words, does the product meet the goal and requirements set by the designers? According to Juran (2000), quality is nothing but ""suitability to use,"" indicating that quality tests performance for its intended use. In project construction, compliance with requirements, specificatio ns, and fitness for a function is equally important in project design, and each customer needs the project being designed to achieve what they intend to achieve. Quality, in other words, is the degree of excellence in which the expectations of customers are met. Construction quality is one of the main concerns facing buyers, designers, and contractors, as defects in this  field are rarely compensated for without substantial expenditure by the parties involved in construction projects. Construction costs re quiring significant current and capital repairs during service make the design  and execution of quality assurance one of the most critical measures for the grateful consumer demands of the finished product. In this context, Radu and Curteanu noted that ""complex scientific problems of construction  quality must be tackled because the consequences of non-quality are much higher than most other goods."" Construction quality is not only a manufacturer’s issue, it is a national issue and, more recently, a European or global issue (Radu & Curteanu, 2002). In order to succeed in this current age, the key for organizations is to maintain quality in both production and services. Therefore, it is desirable that the requirements of the consumers are met by the entities that are responsible for developing, producing, and supplying the products/services with the intention of meeting quality. When achieving quality goals, companies are often faced with certain obstacles called 'quality gaps'. These quality gaps are the result of a lack of understanding of consumer needs, such as product design and process requirements, proper implementation and monitoring of manufacturing and quality control systems, and an inefficient way to deliver services to customers. According to SR EN ISO 9000: 2006, “Quality Management Systems. Fundamentals and Vocabulary”,  Quality Management is “All activities of a general management system that identify and enforce the quality policy, goals and responsibilities, by means such as quality system planning, control, quality assurance, and improvement.” Deac and Vrâncuþ (2012) believe that “The quality management project is there for all the processes required to ensure consistency between the requirements imposed by the beneficiary before the start of this project and the final result”",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513

This includes understanding how to evaluate emerging technologies towards formulation of new products and services as well as wider practical and transferable skills, such as understanding financial management, risk management, intellectual property and other commercial considerations associated with developing new technologies. This research study provides  insights gained from the delivery of technology entrepreneurship  education for students as part of graduate level engineering programs . This involves students working in project-based teams to evaluate emerging technologies and subsequently prepare a business plan for new venture creation. The experiential learning model is augmented with teaching material and theoretical content on both technology management and business management. The study build s on a supporting literature review to provide an exploration of the main elements of this model for technology entrepreneurship education for engineers, including insights on the pedagogical aspects as well as the unique combination of business and technological focused content. The study concludes with a summary of lessons learned from this application of entrepreneurship education for engineers, which can help practitioners to deliver related programs and inform future research studies. Keywords Engineering education, technology entrepreneurship, project-based learning, start-up formation. Introduction It is widely recognized that entrepreneurship education can benefit engineers (Philbin, 2020) through enabling access to a wider set of transferable skills thereby providing greater options to adapt to future work and career changes (RAE, 2017a).  Indeed, it has been found that there is a growing need for multidisciplinary engineers with access to a wider set of skills (Philbin et al., 2019), where equipping engineers with improved skills and knowledge in entrepreneurship can be viewed in this context (Barba-Sánchez and Atienza-Sahuquillo, 2018). These wider skills have been described as being part of the engineering habits of the mind, which includes systems thinking, adapting, problem -finding, creative problem-solving, visualizing and improving – ultimately focused on enabling the core engineering objective of “ making things that work and making things work better ” (RAE, 2017b). Furthermore, inclusion of entrepreneurship education into engineering programs can support the development of soft skills across areas such as project management, teamwork, communication as well as personal development  (Soares et al., 2013 ). These enterprise related  competencies are viewed as being valuable skills  to possess when graduates are pursuing employment opportunities (Galloway et al., 2006). In order to improve the entrepreneurial mindset of  engineers and over the last couple of decades , there has been an increasing preponderance of academic institutions that have integrated entrepreneurship and business management course s and materials into engineering programs (Nichols and Armstrong, 2003). The case for incorporating entrepreneurship into engineering education can also be linked to the current and potential future challenges and opportunities that engineering faces. Such challenges include mitigating the impact of climate change and adopting renewable forms of energy; enabling sustainable development across society and achievement of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs); providing access to health care, which is becoming increasingly costly; and not least continuing to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic. In this context, for a treatment of how innovation can drive forward sustainable development , see the work of Silvestre  and Ţîrcă (2019). These challenges are however accompanied by many opportunities, such as those associated with the Industry 4.0 technological paradigm (Dalenogare et al., 2018)  and related technologies including the internet -of-things, artificial intelligence and digital twins.

6,ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT MASTERS PROGRAMS: ADMINISTRATIVE AND CURRICULAR STRUCTURE,@UNL.edu,,"The American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) champions the advancement of engineering management (EM) profession a nd discipline of study, publishes several content domains in the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK), and recommends EMBOK as beneficial and necessary to those who wish to pursue a career in EM. However, research and evidence are not prevalent on how closely EM Masters programs have embraced EMBOK or the extent to which their curriculum is aligned with its domains. Moreover, administrative structure of EM graduate programs is not uniform and the degree to which they differ may be a matter of interest to all EM programs, employers, and ASEM. Yet, there is little prior work or recent studies that report aggregate summaries of administrative practices and structure of EM programs. In 2020 the Council of Engineering Management Academic Leaders (CEMAL) embarked on a project by creating a survey to poll EM academic leaders and learn about administrative structure and curricular content of EM master’s degree programs. The project was approved by the ASEM Board of Directors, and feedback from several EM academic leaders was solicited and graciously provided to finalize the survey. This paper reports summaries of findings collected by that survey  and inform on the state of EM master’s degree programs in the United States and internationally. Results will benefit all institutions to benchmark and evaluate their programs with respect to administrative structure and curricular content relative to collective and aggregate findings from national and international institutions that offer EM master’s degrees. Introduction and Literature Review The evolution and rise of E ngineering Management (EM) as a discipline of study may not date back to that of other engineering fields, but the significance, impact, and growth of EM is undeniable as the discipline has made impressive strides in the past four decades. In this section we will present a review of the literature about the history and evolution of the EM discipline, the growth of EM graudate education programs, program certification, the development of  the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK), and a review of EM graduate education. History and evolution of EM discipline: The field of Engineering Management has come a long way since Babcock & Sarchet (1981) asked “Is Engineering Management a Profession?” Engineering Management has firmly established itself as a discipline with its own academics, research agenda, literature, professional societies and conferences, body of knowledge, and other related scholarly activities (Kocaoglu, 1989; Kotnour & Farr, 2005). Although the EM field is rather young, its growth has been significant (Kocaoglu, 1994; Wyrick & Cisse, 2008; Daughton, 2017). Growth of EM graduate education programs: The development and growth of EM educational programs is well documented in the literature (Waters, 1994; Kotnour & Farr, 2005; Omurtag, 2009), the earliest being Kocaoglu’s presentation at the 92nd American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference in 1984  . Kocaogul followed that presentation with updated information in 1990, and another article in 1994. Engineering Management education programs have kept pace with the growth of the profession and the demand for high quality engineering managers (Kocaoglu, 1994; Omurtag, 2009; Daughton, 2017). The number of master’s degree level graduates and institutions granting those degrees grew consistently since the 60’s (Wyrick, 2008), but in 2017 Daughton reported that the number of programs reporting graduates had leveled-off. One challenge in tracking the growth of EM education is defining what constitutes an engineering and/or technology management education program (Daughton, 2017).

The lack of data -driven decisions in these areas negatively impacts the ability of the Army to accomplish its vision of having the best equipp ed Army that maintains the technological advantage and capabilities against any threat in any environment. This study facilitates data -driven decisions and analysis that can be expanded and applied to vehicles in the ground mobility fleet. This effort targ ets the Army’s ground mobility fleet, with an initial focus on the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). This study provides data analysis and visualization of the lifecycle of the HMMWV to inform and facilitate decision- making. This study also develops a model to project the economic impact of the current HMMWV fleet using Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation accounts for uncertainty inherent in military operations and variability in the use of the fleet.

As in other industries, the ability to understand the customers’ experience and how they define value are central to the success of the online food delivery industry. In this study, we developed a conceptual framework which ties together all the intervening factors affecting online food delivery. Additionally, we conducted a customer survey aimed at studying these variables and used statistical tools and decision tree analysis for understanding the influential factors in online food delivery business. This proposed methodology can facilitate decision makers to be tter understand the most important factors contributing to customer overall satisfaction, and act accordingly to accommodate their needs. Keywords online food delivery industry, customer satisfaction survey, decision tree analysis Introduction Delivering mail and packages is not a modern-day industry. As early as 1852, Wells Fargo started to help customers moving gold and other items to newly established territories, what was known as the earliest private express company. In the late 1800’s to early 1900’s, the invention of railway systems and cars, rapidly changed the industry and made delivering packages possible far and wide. Speed and convenience started becoming more important to customers in this era. Unlike the traditional way of delivering restaurant meals to the home, online food delivery connects food providers and customers with a website or an app, which highly improves the business visibility and convenience, but simultaneously sets up a higher requirement on the ordering and del ivery management process. Consequently, the interrelationship between the product—food—and the service—delivery—is even more complicated. According to Statista, the business of online meal delivery, is undergoing rapid growth. The revenue of this sector increased to $91.4 billion USD in 2018, and is expected to reach $156.8 billion USD in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 11.4%. Meanwhile, the number of users of this service is expected to rise from 1013.4 million in 2018 to 1635.6 million in 2023, which makes this industry a growing force that should not be ignored (Statista, 2019). Online Food Delivery comprises two service solutions for prepared meals: ⅰ) Platform -to-Consumer (P2C) Delivery and ⅱ) Restaurant -to-Consumer (R2C) Delivery. The Platform -to-Consumer segment focuses on delivery services that provide customers with meals  from partner restaurants, and the platform (e.g., Uber Eats, Doordash) handles the delivery process. In the Restaurant -to-Consumer Delivery segment, the delivery of meals is processed directly by the restaurants. The order can be made via platforms (e.g., Delivery Hero) or directly through a restaurant website (e.g., Domino's, Pizza Hut). The share of these two segments in total revenue was almost equal in 2019. However, based on industry forecast, the segment of R2C, which had a larger revenue in 2018, is constantly losing its market share and expected to become $7,533 million less than the revenue of P2C segment by 2023 (Statista, 2019). During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in order to avoid public gathering, restaurants worldwide have been ordered to close or limit dine-in service by local governments and offer takeaway-only services. The coronavirus crisis further accelerated consumers' shift to third -party delivery apps. According to NPD Group (an American market research company), online ordering and delivery orders soared 67% in March 2020, even though overall restaurant traffic dropped 22% (Lucas, 2020).

10,EVALUATING SMALL MODULAR REACTORS AS PART OF ENERGY TRANSITION PORTFOLIOS,@mst.edu,,"National and global priorities to reduce the environmental footprint require a transition to decarbonized energy. Energy transition portfolios frequently include greater integration of nuclear energy as part of the approach; however, the analysis fails to address the risk and uncertainty of their implementation into the energy grid  as part of the anal ysis. Although the public perception of nuclear power is less negative than it once was, there are still concerns along with regulatory barriers. This study compares energy output from Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) against outputs from renewable generation as part of an energy transition plan from fossil fuels. Challenges with industrial capacity and manufacturing requirements for SMRs, along with regulatory concerns, are also considered. Engineering managers in the power industry can use these results to p roduce an energy portfolio for nuclear energy generation that considers both controllable and uncontrollable forces of engineered systems. Key Words Small Modular Reactors; Energy Transition Portfolio; Sustainable Energy; SAM Analysis Introduction This research evaluates the role  of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as part of an energy transition portfolio that can reduce carbon footprint. In 2020 nuclear power provided the U.S. 20% of its power roughly equal to renewables and slightly more than coal at 19%, but nuclear power is still far outpaced by natural gas at 40% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021). Despite its low utilization, nuclear power has strong ability to meet national power needs and recent advancements in SMR technology is esp ecially promising. The Department of Energy defines SMRs as those reactor designs that are equal to or over 300MWe and fabricated in modules that are transportable from the factory to the site by rail or truck (Black, 2010). In this study, an integrated literature review will be used, along with a State of the Art Matrix (SAM) Analysis to evaluate opportunities for the engineering management researcher to better understand the changing  environment. SAM analyses consist of compiling critical information from  the integrated literature review and presenting it in a matrix format (Hale, &  Long, 2018). Engineering managers can use the research conducted in this study to identify the keypoints to determine economic feasability along with recognizing the areas for improvement. Barriers to entry for SMR technology will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of SMRs to replace fossil fuels when compared to renewable energy. Methodology This study implements an integrated literature review and SAM analysis to eval uate the weaknesses and strengths of SMRs compared to renewable energies along with the barriers of entry with the adoption of SMRS to determine the best implementation of SMRs in the U.S. energy grid.  The federal government and N uclear Regulatory Commission will play an essential role in the adoption of widespread usage of SMRs. A government funded study by the University of Chicago describes some of the hurdles that must be overcome for the continued development of SMRs( Rosner & Goldberg, 2011).

11,FULLY-BURDENED HOURLY COST OF AN ARMY WHEELED VEHICLE MECHANIC,@westpoint.edu,"Engineering economy, Monte Carlo simulation, Army, mechanic, hourly rate.","Many Army acquisition and lifecycle cost decisions require accurate estimates of operating costs which include labor costs of mechanics. It is well known that Army service yields a variety of benefits in addition to base pay (i.e. salary). These benefits include free healthcare, retirement fund matching, monetary incentives for reenlistment, education benefits, and pensions, among others. It is difficult to calculate the monetary values of these variables due to statistical uncertainty and the Army not providing clear costs for its internal services (e.g. healthcare) . Moreover, the Army profession is very fluid and soldiers do not have set working hours, a nd often change their specialization as they progress through the ranks. Combined, these elements increase the amount that the government spends per soldier and introduce complex variability in calculating the true cost of paying a s oldier. For instance, the amounts that soldiers contribute to their retirement accounts vary on individual and yearly bases. Additionally, soldiers retire from service at different ranks and after having served for different periods of time, changing their pension value s. This s tudy develops a model to determine the amount that the United States government  spends on average for each wheeled vehicle mechanic per hour, accounting for the aforementioned deterministic and stochastic variables. The study creates an economic cost model by calculating the net present value of the total compensation of Army wheeled vehicle mechanics. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation is run in order to examine how variability in the data affects the objective value. Keywords Engineering economy, Monte Carlo simulation, Army, mechanic, hourly rate. Introduction The department of defense does not have an estimate for how much it spends on average per Army soldier in a given military occupational specialt y (MOS). Reasons for this include the undefined length of an Army workday, the fact that soldiers of different ranks (and thus different pay and benefits)  have the same MOS, and that the distribution of ranks in a given MOS differs from unit to unit. Additionally, there is  complexity in calculating some of these compensation-related costs directly (e.g. the military-provided healthcare system is primarily  staffed by military personnel). Moreover, under the new Blended Retirement System (BRS) which was implemented in 2018, there are ways for soldiers to increase the amount  of money they receive from the government. These include allocating up to a certain percentage of their pay to a matching retirement account and serving for longer periods of time. This study deals with calculating the average fully-burdened amount of money that the government spends for each wheeled vehicle mechanic (91B MOS) per hour. Background The total compensation of Army soldiers is comprised of multiple streams of income in addition to significant benefits. For all soldiers, these include base pay , or monthly salary , which has a positive relationship  with rank and years of service; basic allowance for housing (BAH) which has a positive relationship with rank; b asic allowance for subsistence (BAS) which is the same for all enlisted soldiers; TRICARE benefits, or health insurance , which covers the individual soldier and their dependents; a uniform allowance, which varies by gender; GI Bill benefits, which are available to all soldiers that have served on active duty for at least 36 months; and retirement benefits under the BRS. The government also incurs other expenses such as special pay (e.g. Jump Pay at Airbo rne units, Language Pay for proficiency in a foreign language, etc.), as well as cost s associated with additional training for soldiers (e.g. Ranger School, Airborne School, etc.) (U.S. Army, 2020).

The current approach to product development by the space industry is vastly different than the automotive industry. As disruptive technologies flow into the market, the space industry is in the midst of an evolutionary change. The methods of design, architecture and management are the topics reviewed in this work. Following a background review of the methods, analysis suggests there may be an opportunity to transfer product development lessons from the automotive industry to the space industry. As the space industry continues to push into a new frontier of lower cost and quicker turnaround solutions, there can be great benefits to employing parts of the methods honed by the automotive industry. The possibilities of gaining knowledge from the automotive industry could in the future lead toward advancements in product development management and product development architecture methods that could continue fueling the evolutionary changes in the space industry. Keywords Product Development, Systems Engineering, Automotive, Space Systems, Concurrent Engineering, Modular Architecture Introduction As the global marketplace continues to thrive, companies are having to adapt their product development processes to create more innovative products faster to compete (Davila, 2000). The space industry is in the midst of an evolutionary change, one that will shape the foundation of future achievements for  decades to come. The space industry has many new space launch suppliers coming into the market providing unprecedented access to space. With the cost to access space dropping, the possibility of achieving different mission requirements is on the rise, giving birth to the feasibility of concepts like proliferated Low-Earth Orbit constellations (Butow, Cooley, Felt, & Mozer, 2020; Ohrwall Rönnbäck & Isaksson, 2018). The challenge the space industry and most satellite makers face is to achieve the monumental task of delivering hundreds to thousands of satellites, quickly, reliably, and affordably. To achieve such production goals , a much-needed change in small satellite development is required. Currently high-end satellite makers can produce low quantity, highly capable satellites at a very large premium for their customers for a variety of mission needs. SpaceX and cubesats manufacturers are pushing into a new frontier of low -cost, limited-flexibility offerings at much higher quantity, converse to the high -end satellite makers. It is yet to be determined how the space industry and satellite makers specifically can move from the cu rrent methods and production rates in the 10’s, to the much -needed future state of methods and production rates in the 100’s or even 1,000’s of satellites per year. The future state for satellite manufacturers could employ some of the lessons learned from another industry, such as the automotive industry. The automotive industry has gone through its own evolutionary changes, transitioning from custom one -off productions to mass production. The automotive industry still to this day has production values ranging from one car per year to one million cars per year. This work attests the following questions to be answered in light of the evolutionary changes in the aerospace and small satellite industry are undergoing: RQ1: Can the small satellite industry adopt product development techniques from the consumer automotive industry? RQ2: Can those concepts learned enable the small satellite industry to achieve the desired output? The product development methods reviewed in this work include product design, product m anagement and product architecture.

13,SELF-STARTING CUMULATIVE SUM CHARTS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF APPLICATION AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS,@ttu.edu,"Statistical Process Monitoring, Control Charts, Self-Starting, Cumulative Sum Charts","Statistical process control (SPC) tools  are increasingly often utilized outside the field of industrial quality control. This paper gives attention to a SPC method that belongs to a special branch of methodologies called self -starting control charts . The method addressed here is the self-starting cumulative sum (SS -CUSUM) chart , the first self - starting method devised. CUSUM charts are powerful statistical tools  designed to detect relatively  small departures from specification. The self-starting variant can be utilized in case the specification is not known a priori. It relies on the running mean and standard deviation of all observations from process start onward to substitute for the unknown true values. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the ongoing utilization of SPC tools outside the field of quality control by identifying existing applications of SS-CUSUM charts discussed in the literature as well as current research directions. To meet these objectives, a systematic literature review was conducted. Two major sectors  have been identified where SS -CUSUM charts are applied successfully outside industrial quality control: Agriculture and healthcare. Further, multiple studies have been found which address the inherent weaknesses of the SS-CUSUM chart and offer compensating measures . This s tudy concludes that  the SS-CUSUM chart has  powerful monitoring capabilities that make it highly useful for various applications outside of industrial quality control and highlights opportunities for future research. Keywords Statistical Process Monitoring, Control Charts, Self-Starting, Cumulative Sum Charts Introduction SPC utilizes statistical methods to detect and diagnose variability in processes, traditionally to improve product quality by removing special cause influences on the manufacturing process. Control charts are among these methods, and they are increasingly often applied outside the field of  industrial quality control . Their areas of application span from agriculture (De Vries & Reneau, 2010), over business, environmental, and financial monitoring (Bersimis, Sgora, & Psarakis, 2018), as well as economics (Enck, Beruvides, Tercero-Gómez, & Cordero-Franco, 2018, 2020), to various fields of healthcare and outbreak detection (Bersimis et al. 2018; Suman & Prajapati, 2018). The concept of special causes was introduced by Shewhart (1931) by the name of assignable causes and refers to “causes of variability in the quality of the product which do not belong to a constant system” (p. 14). Two types of special cause variability can be distinguished: Transient causes that affect the process for a short while, then disappear only to possibly reappear in the future  and persistent causes that endure until the problem is detected and diagnosed. Shewhart control charts, such as Xbar and R charts, ar e highly effective in detecting isolated special causes, making them the SPC tool of choice to identify variability from transient causes.  However, they are not very effective in detecting persistent causes that express themselves in small shifts of the mean. To detect this kind of special cause, CUSUM charts that accumulate information from successive readings can be utilized. While powerful in detecting persistent shifts in the process data, CUSUM charts require that the true mean and standard deviation of the assumingly normally distributed data are known exactly (Hawkins & Olwell, 1998). Precise estimates can be obtained by a Phase I study where the process is measured for a pre-defined time period while it is in a state of statistical control.

14,IMPLEMENTING BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS AND TOPIC MODELLING TO INFORM CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOR ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,@up.ac.za,"Engineering Management, Topic Modelling, Curriculum, Natural Language Processing.","This paper aims to inform the course curriculum development for a master 's degree in Engineering Management. Implementing a bibliometric analysis with topic modelling performed on relevant publications in the field of Engineering Management provides valuable inputs to the selection of content for a curriculum. Topic modelling is a form of unsupervised machine -learning-based natural language processing. The algorithm extracts main topics from the titles and abstracts of a wide range of papers published about Engineering Management. These topics are identified and compared, for validation, to current thinking about Engineering Management curriculums. This approach is implemented to ensure that the course content is relevant to the field of Engineering Management. Keywords Engineering Management, Topic Modelling, Curriculum, Natural Language Processing. Introduction Engineering Management (EM) is a dynamic, flexible, and continuously changing domain of engineering. Traditional engineering curricula utilizes structured problems and a bottom -up approach. Socio- technical systems are generally complex and dynamic, requiring a systems thinking approach (Lo Storto, 2008) . The application of management knowledge in engineering fields is related to organizational performance  (Paton & Wagner, 2014). According to Lima et al. (2012), engineering managers have to perform a wide range of jobs , making the desig n and development of a curriculum to teach EM at our universities a challenging  endeavour. In addition, EM  has to develop, improve, and manage systems composed of people, equipment, information, financial resources, and energy to deliver products and services to stakeholders . Demarcating EM from other overlapping fields, such as Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering, Production Engineering, and Manufacturing Engineering , compounds the problem of curriculum development (Benis et al., 2020; Rui M. Lima et al., 2012). Curriculum development is critical to successful engineering programmes.  EM practices continue to evolve and increasingly become integrated as boundaries between disciplines fade, placing new curriculum demands (Buyurgan & Kiassat, 2017) . Developing the EM curriculum for a university needs to  consider the environment where its graduates will be em ployed (J. Jiang & Rao, 2014) . Other factors to be considered during curriculum development include the competition with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)  with online or contact lectures (Celik, 2016) and the challenges engineering managers will face during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Also, cyber-physical systems in the 4IR , combining data and communication  through digital platforms  to improve manufacturing and production, place new demands on EM. Therefore, data science is an example of another emerging area to be addressed in EM curricula (Benis et al., 2020; Karbasian & Johri, 2020; Mlange, 2017). Cai et al. (2021) listed the current problems with EM courses as still using conventional teaching mode, low level of informatization  and i nsufficient integration  between theoretical knowledge and practice. S ystem processes are insufficiently mastered with limited insight about engineering life cycle processes and forward -looking knowledge.

Many companies were forced to transition to a strictly telecommuting environment due to the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result, engineering organizations and teams needed to quickly assess how they could continue their mission and achieve their goals with minimal disruption to their existing workflow.  For some, the transition was far easier than others due to the established processes, procedures, and information systems already in place.  This paper explores the structure of a Digitally Integrated Systems Engineering (DISE) team, their framework (pro cess, procedures, methods, tools, and environment), the transition to remote work, the successes and challenges of that transition, and potential implications for the future. Keywords MBSE, model-based systems engineering, remote work, systems engineering. Introduction The applied research division of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) is the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).  Based in Atlanta, Georgia, and with multiple field offices throughout the United States, GTRI is a nonprofit organization conducting sponsored research for government and industry customers.  The way GTRI describes the people who work there, “With more than 2,000 full -time engineers and scientists, as well as additional faculty members, part -time students and consultants and support personnel, GTRI's team -based approach gives our researchers the flexibility to solve problems creatively as well as advance careers.” (GTRI, 2021). GTRI as an organization comprises eight laboratories, each with their own f ocuses in specific engineering domains.  These laboratories work together to conduct research and deliver cutting -edge technical solutions to their customers.  Multiple divisions and program offices comprise a laboratory, and each of these units contribute s to the success of each laboratory, and in turn, GTRI.  While a program office may not be that large in scale, a division is composed of multiple teams, each with a specific scientific or engineering specialty that provides their expertise across multiple sponsored efforts. This paper focuses on the Software Engineering and Architecture Division (SEAD) within the Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Laboratory (SEAL).  Specifically, within SEAD, there is a team focused on providing systems engineering expertise and support to multiple, large-scale Department of Defense projects.  This team employs a digitally integrated systems engineering approach as a cornerstone to build digital models of complex systems of systems that aim to serve as the single source of truth for their respective programs. What is DISE? Digitally Integrated Systems Engineering (DISE) is “the integration of systems engineering processes, practices, and artifacts into an authoritative digital repository  of information and knowledge about the systems of interest, their users, and their environments through the use of one or more formal languages.” (Adams, 2020) The primary artifact of DISE is a digitally integrated systems engineering model that can be used to support various aspects of a system’s development lifecycle.  DISE is broader in scope than Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and conveys the notion of the single systems engineering environment.

The study include s 197 supervisors from construction, power -sector, transportation, chemical industries, manufacturing and production. Based on 197 responses received from a f irst-line supervisor survey, 699 quotations are coded using the Atlas.ti computer -aided qualitative data analysis software. These quotations  are grouped into 12 categories. The literature review i s used t o locate the emergent categories in the broader body of knowledge and to further refine them and present them as first-line supervisor responsibilities. Keywords First-line supervision, organizational management, engineering work-teams. Introduction First-line supervisors (FS) are at the forefront of implementation as they work closest to the employees and are the most significant point of leverage for the organization to implement and enact policies. In high -performing organizations, first -line super visors are key actors who play important roles. The role of a supervisor is critical, challenging, and often unappreciated. This role must be performed effectively if work teams are to opt imize their effectiveness. Methodology To collate and consolidate the responsibilities associated with the FS role, a qualitative research methodology was used. The first step of the methodology was to design and distribute a data collection questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 650 supervisors from construction, power-sector, transportation, chemical industries, manufacturing and production using a web-based survey as the distribution method . Each response received was evaluated and this led to 197 usable responses (30% response rate). According to Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill  (2012), a response rate that is too low may lead to a high likelihood of statistical biases and points out that a response rate higher that 20% is generally accepted as good enough in most fields of research. Respondents listed th e core responsibilities associated with their supervisory role and these responses were analyzed using the Atlas.ti computer -aided qualitative data analysis software.

It involves product procurement of raw materi als, production, storage, distribution, wholesales, and retail sales. The COVID19 pandemic has the added challenge of healthcare service operations management. This paper is a bibliometric study of the COVID19 supply chain fragility problem. In February 20 21, the United States’ P resident called for a review of the pandemic related supply chain for vaccines, personal protective equipment (PPE), medical equipment such as ventilators, and food. This study involves a search for references published between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021. It reveals that food was a primary topic among 82  publications rather than vaccines. Also, reasons cited for America’s supply chain fragility include America’s dependence on products produced in other countries such as China ; these countries’ own pandemic induced supply chain challenges ; and US trade restrictions on such products enacted prior to the COVID19 outbreak. Engineering management strategies were mentioned in 60% of the publications and are summarized in the Conclusions and Implications for Managers are provided. Keywords COVID19, COVID- 19 vaccine, supply chain management, supply chain disruption, supply chain fragility, engineering management, operations management, pandemic food, China manufacturing, semiconductor chips, disaster relief, infectious diseases Introduction The following introduction sets the stage for explaining events that led to the current global COVID19 supply chain fragility problem. In order to suppress the outbreak of COVID19, the World Health Organization (WHO) escalated the threat levels and alarmed the general public against inaction. WHO recommended lockdowns, quarantines, testing, contact tracing, isolation, mask wearing and school closures (WHO, 2020b) . Disruptions to the global supply chain dominated the news. The I nstitute for Supply Manageme nt (ISM) reported that 95% of US businesses experienced supply chain disruptions ( ISM, 2020). This research is relevant to the engineering and business disciplines of operations and supply chain management. The purpose of this study is to make sense of the  news stories. A bibliometric review of publications between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was conducted. This paper describes the key findings related to vaccine, personal protective equipment (PPE), medical equipment ( such as ventilators ), food and semiconductors. The goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID19 global supply chain in our interconnected world. This study concludes with conclusions based on the findings and recommendations which serve to improve supply chain management of future outbreaks and disasters requiring relief such as COVID19. In July 2020, Patrick Valliance, Chief Scientific Advisor stated  that “mistakes were made” (Triggle, 2021). Max Boot, Senior Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations called the handling of resources by the USA, the richest country in the world, a failure (CNN, 2020). There are bottlenecks across the entire global supply chain: raw materials, manufacturing, human capital, regulations, and geopolitics. By late July 2020, 25 vaccines were in clinical trials (Goodman & Carmichael, 2020). Vaccine production is very complex. There is a need for heightened quality control (Tin, 2021). Nathalie Moll of the EFPIA stated that while there is a need for increased manufacturing, the production requires security and efficiency; and substantial training to increase capacity (EFPIA, 2021).  In 2020, the President made little use of the Defense  Production Act’s broad authority to compel US manufacturers to make equipment needed to combat COVID19  (LeBlanc, 2020). Vaccine equity is a concern. Those closer to vaccine manufacturing will get vaccines first in the developed world (Irwin, 2021). Countries such as the UK, Israel, US and Canada are better prepared because they made orders with pharmaceutical manufacturers earlier (Twohey, Collins, & Thomas, 2020) . Canada secured vaccines in an amount five times their population (Hegarty, 2020).

As businesses struggle to meet customer demand with new products, services, and delivery models, engineers must adapt to meet their needs. This quantitative survey study examined the relationship of emotional intelligence (EI), work locus of control (LOC), and innovative work behavior (IWB) of engineers. In an analysis of survey responses for 30 6 engineers belonging to professional organizations in the United States, we used multiple regression to determine if EI was related to IWB and if LOC moderated the relationship. We measured EI using the TEIQue-SF, which consists of 30 questions for 15 facets of EI. To measure LOC, we used Spector’s  16 items for internal and external work LOC. For IWB, we used de Jong and den Hartog’s six items that measure employee rated innovative output. We found that EI was a significant predictor of IWB, and that LOC significantly moderated the relationship. This research is helpful for engineering managers to understand human characteristics such as EI and LOC that drive IWB. Keywords Emotional Intelligence, Innovative Work Behavior, Locus of Control Introduction Now more than ever, businesses need innovative work behavior. As COVID-19 changed how companies do business, organizations need individuals who can examine work products and processes to develop new ways of creating and meeting demand. The innovation process usually consists of a mixed team approach bringing design, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing together for new products and services (Tsakalerou, 2016).  The combined EI of the team is important to the innovation process and management of intellectual capital flows in the organization (Massaro, Dumay, & Garlatti, 20 15). An individual’s emotional intelligence (EI) affects team interactions and innovative performance (Tsakalerou, 2016). The EI  of the team leader is important in team interactions and effectiveness to improve innovative product development (Rezvani , Chang, Ashkanasy, Jordan, & Zolin, 2016). High EI increases knowledge sharing and positively impacts team performance among team members (Verma & Sinha, 2016). In this research, we focus on innovation at the individual level of contribution to services, products, and processes necessary for the organization's sustainability. The purpose of the quantitative survey research was to examine whether EI is a predictor of innovative work behavior (IWB) and if job locus of control (LOC) moderated the relationship for engineers working in companies in the United States. This research contributes to the field of engineering management by offeri ng insight into employee drivers of innovation. By examining whether EI and LOC impact IWB, engineering managers can better understand employee characteristics that promote IWB. First, we analyze the impact of EI on IWB for engineers in the United States so that organizations have a better understanding of the relationship. Second, we analyze the impact of an individual’s work LOC on innovative work behavior. This research is important because as companies seek to promote innovative behaviors management needs to understand characteristics of engineers that lead to greater innovation.",point.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Two classifications of improvements are observed, with one characterised through incremental improvement over a period of sustained Kaizen activities and another of breakthrough improvement of all at once. Purpose of the paper The constant consumer demand and technology changes necessitated the review of contribution in terms of capability maturity in both service and manufacturing industries. It is observed by Jones, C., and Pimdee, P.

Lean Six Sigma (LSS) was defined as a business performance improvement strategy by Antony (2002). Despite the popularity of LSS methodology and its recognised benefits, the methodology has proven to be one of the processes that are the least sustained (Pillet & Maire, 2008). The strategy process defines the direction of the company while the implementation creates the future. Snee (2010) observed the failure of improvement programmes to be associated with poor implementation. Hrebiniak (2006) found failure to effectively manage change and defeat resistance to change to be highest ranking obstacle that can decrease the ability to execute the strategy. The radical change of practices associated with LSS was found to be amongst some of the probable reasons creating difficulty in sustaining LSS implementations. This paper’s objective is to identify the change management factors responsible for moving the process both forward and/or backward during the LSS implementation process.  The research also purposed to expand the body of knowledge on factors affecting the sustainability of LSS. The information from this research from the research could help to provide knowledge on the types of sustainability possible in LSS implementation and the factors required to be in place for sustainability to be possible. Positive feedback was received in terms of measures of LSS sustainability. Noted is the of the predictors for LSS sustainability received generally high scoring. The findings of the research survey confirmed that majority of enabling factors were observed to be often present in the case companies. This included (i) employees’ support and involvement, and changes in Six Sigma to Lean Six -Sigma, (ii) except for co mprehensive employee training and education, effective frequent and bi -directional communication, measurement and monitoring of results, correct selection of LSS tools. Keywords Lean Six Sigma, Implementation strategy, Sustainability, Change management forces. Introduction There are suggestions from literature that the factors or processes that influence sustainability are still not well understood (Wiltsey-Stirman et al., 2012; Savaya & Spiro, 2012; Shediac -Rizkallah & Bone, 1998). However, for sustainability to become a routine component of programme evaluation there is a need for greater clarity about obstacles to sustainability and their causes (Savaya et al., 2008). Process and change management practices, along with the change in environment, contribute to better business processes, which is a requisite in achieving measurable gains and sustainable competitive performance (Drago & Geisler, 1997). The main objective of this study was to develop a dynamic model which could be used by South African organisations to predict and sustain LSS initiatives. The research has also undertaken to expand the body of knowledge on the factors affecting the sustainability of LSS inside South African companies as a secondary objective. To explore sustainability, t he research purposes to give components of hypothesis to clarify the fundamental processes of sustainability identified as continuation, routinization and institutionalization. The fundamental research question for this study is specified as; - “How should organisations incorporate prioritising LSS sustainability planning earlier in the adoption process considering the key features, obstacles and shortcomings of the methodology?",uj.ac.za,University of Johannesburg,South Africa,-26.18493745,27.99979246435022
23,SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR: AN EVALUATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT FACTORS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL INNOVATIVE BEHAVIOR IN SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS,@uah.edu,"Innovation, innovative behavior, social support, emotional support, information support, legitimacy support.","Individual scientists and engineers are key contributors of innovation in research and de velopment organizations. In today's environment, organizational leaders and managers have an important responsibility to shape the organizational structure and culture in a way that encourages individual innovative behavior. Recent research has investigate d the relationship between the social environment within an organization and individual behaviors related to the generation, promotion, and implementation of new ideas. Previous studies have focused on supervisor and co-worker relationship quality or on th e characteristics of an individual’s social network and how those factors encourage or  impede innovative behavior. This  prior research confirms the influence of the organizational social environment, but additional research is needed to better understand h ow innovative behavior is influenced by that social environment. To do this, we operationaliz e the content of social interactions  in an organization as three types of social support: emotional support, informational support, and legitimacy support.  We present a review of the innovative behavior literature and presen t a research methodology to study the relationship between individual innovative behavior and these different types of social support. Finally, we present preliminary results from  a pilot study with university engineering students and discuss the implications for the full research study with professional scientists and engineers in a large government funded research and development organization. Keywords Innovation, innovative behavior, social support, emotional support, information support, legitimacy support. Introduction Innovation has long been recognized by academics, practitioners, and general observers as an important, if not essential, element to the success of organizations ( Anderson, Potočnik, and Zhou,  2014). However, recent data suggests that, despite technological advances, innovations have been slow to be adopted and to impact organizational productivity generally (Mitchell, 2019). As such, innovation remains an important topic for leaders and managers of scientists and engineers. Leaders and managers have a responsibility to foster an organizational culture and environment that supports individual actions and behaviors related to innovation. Effective leadership and management of the innovation process in organizations has the potential to improve innovative output and benefit the organization and also the greater society, contributing to greater employee satisfaction, economic prosperity, and societal well-being (Anderson et al., 2014; Van de Ven, 1986; West & Farr, 1990). Encouraging innovation in organizations begins with motivating the behaviors and actions of individual employees. These behaviors go beyond just creating or inventing new things to include building support for innovative ideas and converting those ideas into realized processes or products (Kanter, 1988). Individual innovative behaviors include idea generation, idea promotion, and idea implementation (Scott & Bruce, 1994). While individual characteristics such as skills and traits are known to influence individual innovative behaviors, organizational factors including resources, job types, and the social -political environment also influence individual innovative behavior (Amabile, 1988; Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin, 1 993). Research has explored the influence of social factors on individual innovative behavior. Much of this research has focused on structure or strength of employee’s social interactions and relationships and the effect on creativity  (Anderson et al., 2014; Baer , Evans, Oldham, & Boasso, 2015; Perry -Smith, 2014).  More recently, the need has been expressed to expand this work to include greater consideration of the content of social interactions on  the broader context of innovative behavior  (Perry-Smith, 2014;",uah.edu,University of Alabama at Huntsville,United States,34.7252,-86.6405
24,UNDERSTANDING LEAN SIX SIGMA TOOLS WITH A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES,@westpoint.edu,"Lean Six Sigma, Manufacturing, 5Ss","Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has revolutionized an organization’s ability to improve their quality, reduce, costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase production efficiency. LSS applies a systematic methodology that include a Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) phase to eliminate waste, streamline production processes, and reduce costs within an organization. This process requires organizations to define the problem, measure its inputs and outputs, analyze statistics, create improvements, and control the system .  Several companies have successfully employed LSS across their organization to improve their process  and provide example of tools and methods.  This paper presents case studies for three companies, 3M, Motorola, and Nike, that demonstrate deferent applications of the LSS methodology.  The 3M case study focuses on the application of LSS methods to the research and development component of 3M and how the company was able to apply a structured analysis approach to their development processes.  Motorola provides an excellent example of the importance of metrics for process improvement and the success organizations can realize through the process.  Finally, the case study on Nike discusses the application of the 5Ss, a critical tool in Lean, to Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain to their manufacturing processes. Keywords Lean Six Sigma, Manufacturing, 5Ss Introduction Lean six sigma has revolutionized an organization’s ability to improve quality, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and produce products more efficiently. Lean six sigma is a systematic methodology used to eliminate waste, streamline production processes, and reduce costs within an organization (Strong, 2018). This process requires organizations to define the problem, measure its inputs and outputs, analyze statistics, create improvements, and control the system (Brook, 2020). There are 5 steps in the lean six sigma process that include Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control: otherwise known as the DMAIC process (George, Rowlands, Price, & Maxey, 2005). The DMAIC process takes an organized and systematic method for strategic process improvement, product, and service development that relies on statistical methods and the scientific method to make dramatic reduction in customer defined defect rate (Antony, Kumar, & Labib, 2008). This paper examines the application of lean six sigma across three companies, 3M, Motorola, and Nike.  The paper begins with a general literature review of Lean Six Sigma with a focus on each of the five phases of the DMAIC process.  These cases are relevant to the engineering management literature in that the present several examples of different perspectives on the implementation of lean six sigma.  In this case of 3M, the paper discusses the application of lean six sigma to the research and development organizations within 3M and some of the challenges that leadership faced during this application.  The portion on the paper that discusses Motorola focuses on the importance of developing metrics within he DM AIC process and the success that Motorola achieved through lean six sigma.  The final case discusses the application of the 5S methodology at Nike and the improvements they were able to achieve in their production processes. The research in this area can  assist future practioners of lean six sigma in the successful implementation of lean six sigma to meet organizational goals and objectives.  In the case of 3M, the importance of culture comes into play as they were able to successfully implement LSS in several areas, but faced resistance within the R&D division.",westpoint.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

This article presents a conceptual framework for viewing education institutions as an open system using the General Systems Theory (GST) and discusses how it could help improve the higher education system.  The author concludes that the education institutions must carefully select the institution’s components; should carefully and strategically manage the internal and external stakeholder network  including all communications and informed decisions; accept that change of student perceptions is a norm and promote agility in the system operations, and also highlights that it is natural for systems to have specialized, outperforming departments/sections. The concepts discussed here could be further researched and would hopefully be of use for policy makers and administrators of higher education systems, while the author also wishes to spark a conversation amongst the citizens. Keywords General Systems Theory (GST), Higher Education Institutions, Open System Model, STEEPLE Factors Introduction The novelty of the COVID -19 virus and the associated risks introduced by the pandemic forced all brick -to-mortar classes to go virtual overnight. As mentioned by Smalley (2020), University of Washington became the first major university to cancel in person classes and ex ams, and by the middle of March, more than 1,100 colleges and universities in all the states in America cancelled in -person classes or shifted to online -only instruction, while many spring graduation ceremonies and other events were also cancelled or postp oned. Although many of the education institutes are experimenting with the hybrid of staggered brick -and-mortar and online class model as a temporary solution for fall semester 2020, the shift to online learning may continue.  The pandemic with its unprece dented challenges including serious public health risk concerns undoubtedly placed online education at utmost priority than ever before. Many academia and students have expressed concerns that some of the changes to the education system might even become p ermanent. Prior to the pandemic, there was already widespread acknowledgement that the traditional higher education business model is seriously challenged. Many students and faculty felt that a university is much more than just tuition and the online only education model. There were also concerns as to whether the students are really receiving value for money via an online only model (Burki, 2020). According to Mcdowall (2016), with the increasing college costs and student debt -load, scrutiny by key stakeholders had already increased. Media headlines such as “Is higher education even worth it?” and “Distrust in academics” were becoming common place across the U.S.  by 2016 (Mcdowall, 2016). According to Lannon  (n.d.), the Fortune magazine labeled the U.S. school system as “our most endangered institution” in 2018, highlighting a growing national concern about the quality of education in America. Gallagher and Palmer mention that the fall 2020 marks a clear inflection point as students, educators, and government leaders alike scrutinized the price and value proposition of higher education through the new lens of traditional classroom versus multiple modes of digital delivery. This is nothing new as Forrester (1990) stated earlier that  the education in United States is generally recognized as serving less and less in meeting current  needs.  As argued by Atwater  et al. (2008), the academic program s in business do not adequately prepare graduates for the ""real world"". These are not new.

Factors related to the environmental components, driver characteristics, and attributes such as light condition, weather, drinking, drowsy driver, distracted driving, etc. contribute to the occurrence of car accidents.  In this paper, - various analyses of the risk factors affecting the severity and frequencies of road collisions  are discussed.  However, Tennessee traffic fatalities and injuries have never been investigated in a study focusing on the impact of the hierarchical relationship of the environmental reasons and driver-related attributes.  In this study, we used a series of hierarchical regression models to measure how well environmental factors explained fatality rates consi dering driver characteristics and attributes using 11,607 records from 95 counties in the state of Tennessee.  The findings showed that the addition of  the environmental factors resulted in a statistically significant increase in fatality rates.  Variables such as various lighting conditions, the type of the first harmful object, and the geographical attributes were found that increased the fatality rate  as well.  Evidence gained from the study can be used by the local government and policymakers to  strategize and design injury prevention measures and road safety regulations Keywords Traffic accidents, road condition, preventive analysis, hierarchical regression analysis Introduction Road crashes are the most common cause of death in the USA, Canada, and the UK among people aged less than 25 years. In addition to fatalities, 4.4 million people are injured severely enough to require medical attention (ASIRT, 2021).  According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data from 2019, Tennessee is the 18th largest state by population but is ranked 9th in the number of deaths due to fatal accidents with 1,135 deaths (IIHS, 2021). Tennessee has the 5th highest in fatalit ies when adjusting for age distribution and population (CDC, 2020) . Human error and environmental factors are directly linked with traffic accidents related to the fatality rate. In this study, the data from the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) is analyzed to study the interrelationship of the fatality rate and the contributing factors associated with it.  TDOT data provides factors that are intuitively connected to fatalities mostly categorized as human factors and environmental factors. There are differ ent kinds of factors taken into consideration such as distracted driving, drowsy drivers, seat belt use, drunk driving, light condition, and weather, etc. These factors, among others, are well researched, documented, and understood.  Meanwhile, some environmental- related factors (e.g. road type) to fatal crushes have not been studied thoroughly even though they may have a potential impact on fatalities as well (FACTS, 2020). In this research, driver and environmental-related factors provided by the TDOT data are considered to determine the level of impact each of the different factors has on fatal ities.

Previous initial system life cycle cost estimates generated independently by the cost community lacked easy integration with the engineering and design community. Any changes in design r equired passing of data inefficiently between various user groups and manual re -evaluation of cost estimates. Prior cost analysis research investigated dynamically integrating a generic wheeled ground vehicle cost model with physics - based ground vehicle engineering and performance models undergoing design analysis. The developed ground vehicle cost model automatically updates vehicle cost with design changes. The previous research also incorporated a time phased life cycle cost estimate for a system under d esign analysis in order to support affordability concerns. Current research efforts employ this methodology for a generic aircraft system cost model leveraging an automated workflow in a high performance computing  environment linking both engineering desig n model and operational analysis simulation output. The development of a dynamically linked cost model with a time-phased cost breakdown provides opportunities for decision makers to understand the financial resource requirements of a proposed system. The cost model development and integration process highlighted additional challenges and opportunities to enhance the generic aircraft cost model. This paper provides an overview of the conceptual workflow for cost model integration, the development of the refined aircraft cost model, challenges associated with updating and linking the aircraft cost model with engineering and operational simulation analysis output, and an overview of proof of concept output  results. Keywords Life cycle cost estimate, Department of Defense Acquisition, Systems Engineering Introduction The Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 adaptive acquisition framework outlines  six different paths towards acquisition of a system and seeks to reduce acquisition timeframes (Department of Defense, 2020). A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report reveals that approximately 50% of the systems analyzed recorded increased total acquisition costs of over $80 billion (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2020). Early conceptual system design decisions impact a large percentage of a system’s life cycle system costs. During the development of a new system, the engineering teams create the conceptual design .

This demand equally increases the need t o evaluate the customer experience to ensure that growth does not come at the price of the customer. As times change in the auto buying/selling platforms this creates a gap when looking at current auto hauling practices and capabilities. There is also a continued pursuit  for excellence- first class service to be delivered in these new times and business models.  While transportation plays a vital role in many organizations, it is even more crucial in this platform. In many cases, transportation is also the organization’s f ace and lifeline to the business model. Like other modes of transport, auto hauling comes with unique opportunities and challenges. This study examines the application of older supply chain philosophies/principles and how to apply them to meet current customer needs. Specifically, of interest is that of reverse scheduling which in this application is a collaboration of just-in-time methodology, reverse logistics, and backward/forward scheduling. This study utilizes different methods, including a survey of p rior research (in varying industry segments), interviews, pilots, data collection and analysis, and feedback from critical stakeholders. Finally, the study provides best practices on one example of how  legacy techniques can be reapplied to deliver a better  customer experience while also yielding some favorable key performance indicators. While this study focuses solely on the preowned online industry’s application, this could be equally applied in other industry segments. Keywords Reverse Scheduling, Used Car Industry, Case Study, Customer-Centric Transportation, Auto-Hauling Introduction The U.S. preowned car industry is an over $153 Billion market comprised of over 120 thousand varying businesses (IBIS World, 2021) . Quite to a surprise, the used car market did not see the huge impact from COVID -19, as may have originally been anticipated and/or seen in other industry segments. While buying preowned is not a new concept, the idea of buying/selling strictly online wit hout ever stepping foot into a dealership is relatively new and forward- thinking for most. This has been even more emphasized due to the recent increase in used car prices because of limited production by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) during the pa ndemic and the desire to have personal transportation over that of public transit in many places. It can be argued if it is the convenience, ease, no haggle pricing, straight up-front terms, selection size, mix model/brands, or no upselling that is driving this market, but what is certain is that the world has become receptive to this method and it is here to stay. This now turns the industry towards more need to discover and redefine how to provide first-class service. A recent report shared online by Steve Greenfield, CEO of Automotiveventures.com, provides  a high-level look at some of the contenders in this market space by market cap—with Carvana dominating the industry with over 45% of total $101 Billion market cap. Research shows that the industry is on the verge of a significant market shift and quickly as consumers have now become more receptive to the idea of online car shopping it may carry well past the recent pandemic (Rosenbaum, 2020). In a recent article published by McKinsey & Company, they discuss the industry and what is influencing the market. The report points out that the car industry stands to lose billions if companies do not look at online platforms for future operations (Hofstatter, Krawina, Muhlreiter, Pohler, & Tschiesner, 2020). There are multiple studies being released now that show global rise in online purchasing continues. One report suggests a 13% increase since the pandemic in looking at online buying options across the world in varying markets (Hofstatter, Krawina, Muhlreiter, Pohler, & Tschiesner, 2020).

However, there is a lack of methodological studies on the food chain for these crops as they move from farm to table. Of particular importance are the risks to processing facilities as these are potential chokepoints in the food chain. Risk s may significantly impact the overall production and inventory schedules, the delivery of finished products, and ultimately adversely affect the profit of enterprises. Therefore, it is important to identify and address risks in the food processing system to assure its optimal performance. This paper identifies potential schedule risks in the HCC production -inventory system and integrates the risks into a stochastic model to optimize the production- inventory schedule for the entire system. Our goal is to de termine the production quantity, inventory level, and energy consumption in each time period so that the total cost for the entire food processing system is minimized. Firstly, we use the Integrated Definition (IDEF) method to identify uncertain food demand and fluctuating energy supply as two major sources of risks for the HCC production- inventory system. Secondly, a stochastic model is introduced to optimize the multi-period production-inventory schedule for the system. Finally, a numerical experiment is carried out to verify and validate the model. Keywords Risk identification, hydroponic crop cultivation, production-inventory schedule, energy resources, stochastic model. Introduction The risks of operating HCC systems come from many sources, especially interruptions to the power supply. Electricity keeps the HCC equipment running, including the water pump, lighting and any necessary temperature and humidity control systems. An unstable power supply may decrease the production rate of HCC systems. A serious power outage may even cause the roots of crops to die from lack of oxygen. HCC companies need to consider the risk of electric power disruptions and its effect on matching their supply of products to consumer demand. Disruptions in supply can lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction, which adverse profits. On the other hand, uncertainties in consumer demand must be considered in production planning since overproduction can lead an increase in production cost. An inventory of products may be used to d ampen short-term mismatches in supply and demand, especially in the face of supply uncertainties introduced by production risks like power interruptions and the variability in consumer demands. Extant research has not provided guidance on how HCC companies should respond to risks the production process or the scheduling of inventory. To help HCC enterprises minimize the total cost in the production-inventory schedule and enhance their competitiveness, we propose a stochastic model to optimize a multi -period production-inventory schedule that addresses potential risks.

The effect of research and development (R&D) on e conomic growth has increased in importance since the shift from a primarily manufacturing based economy that evolved from th e Industrial Revolution to a knowledge-based economy that is characterized by a focus on innovation to achieve increased productivi ty.  A pioneer of endogenous growth theory, Paul Romer’s paper “Endogenous Technological Change” directed the conversation of economic growth from a Malthusian perspective focused on population growth to a perspective of inclusivity.  This shift occurred due to the expansive nature of ideas by recognizing that, as an input, technology is a nonrival, partially excludable good.   This paper reviews the role of R&D, the endogenous characteristics of technological growth , and studies the relationship between R& D and economic growth.  In addition, this paper explores the strengths and potential downfalls of the current research trends in this area and the impact this research has on industrial and systems engineering. Keywords Economics of Knowledge; endogenous growth; public policy; knowledge-oriented, research and development. Introduction Understanding the connection between research and development and macroeconomic growth is vital to engineering managers because it encourages them to comprehend the overall system and how their decisions have a direct impact on the system’s functionality .  To better understand the relationship between technology and economic growth, this paper will focus on the schools of thought that have influenced and shaped contemporary growth theories.  Economic growth theories have experienced many changes over the course of history .  Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations marks the beginning of Classical Economic Theory that attributes economic growth to land, labor, and capital.  A key aspect of the classical school of thought is the focus on the effect populations have on an economy’s realized and potential growth.  Contemporary growth theories have moved past this focus by incorporating technology and knowledge as inputs in growth models, further tying together economic growth and the firms that support it.  The articles chosen for this paper have each greatly influenced the development of endogenous growth theories by either laying the foundation for advancing economic theories or introducing revolutionary ways of utilizing production inputs in economic models. This discussion will begin with Thomas Malthus’ explanation of economic growth according to population growth to provide a historical backdrop to then introduce the effect of the Industrial Revolution on economic growth. After examining this shift in regimes,  Solow’s Growth Model will be presented to provide a foundation for the development of endogenous growth and the introduction of knowledge economics spearheaded by Paul Romer.  The impact of m acroeconomics will then be applied to  the influence it excerts o n industrial and systems engineering industries to provide a view of how macroeconomic growth theory is relevant to engineers and technical managers. The Background of Knowledge Economics Malthus and Industrial Revolution Prior to modern growth theories,  researchers primarily based their assumptions and macroeconomic growth models on the Malthusian population principle.  During Thomas Malthus’ period of study, both economic and population growth were stagnant; as a result, Malthus (Malthus, 1817) developed his theory of economic growth.  The Malthusian model is based on three assumptions: each society has a birth rate that is positively related to wages; each society has a death rate that is inversely related to wages; and population size and wages are inversely related.

33,REMOTE WORKING STRATEGY INDUCED BY COVID-19: A CASE STUDY,@utc.edu,"COVID-19, remote working, R&D engineers, software company","With the hope of regaining their pre-pandemic level of operations and certainties, companies who employ knowledge workers wonder whether working from home will be the main modality of employment going forward. The managers should understand the problems and opportunities and need to develop successful management strategies. This study analyzed the feasibility of remote working and looked for ways to improve employees’ productivity while working at home.  A survey was conducted on R&D engineers of a software company.  Most employees reported no change in their productivity and less change in their physical health, while most employees reported an improvement in their mental health. The top four benefits of remote working are stress reduction from commuting, more freedom, location independence, and better work -life balance. The top three challenges are face -to-face interactions, dealing with distraction, and bad health habits. The top four tools that employees found necessary were face-to-face meetings at least once per month, better hardware and equipment, training and learning, and opportunities for non-work-related remote social interactions. The study indicates that regular face-to-face meetings are essential for successful remote collaboration.   Also, if possible, a hybrid schedule should be considered, with remote work two or three days per week.  A framework model for successful remote working programs was developed to summarize the findings of this study and to serve as a reference for decision making and further analysis. Finally, a remote work program’s success can be measured through four factors: safety and regulatory compliance, environmental impact, pr oductivity and cost reduction, and worker satisfaction. Keywords COVID-19, remote working, R&D engineers, software company Introduction Due to technological innovations, such as the telephone, fax machine, personal computer, internet, email, and video conferencing, remote work has been increasingly possible since at least the 1980s.  In 1989, Wall Street Journal columnist and management expert Peter Drucker wrote the following: “Commuting to office work is obsolete. It is now infinitely easier, cheaper and faster to do what the 19th Century could not do -  move information, and with its office work, to where the people are” (Boyd, 2018).  However, this transition was not as fast or complete as he anticipated.  More than 30 years after his statement, most of the office work is still done by people who commute to their jobs. The recent coronavirus that swept the world has had a major influence on how companies operate.  During the governmental stay- at-home orders, many companies shut their office doors compl etely when their workers were declared non-essential.  Companies with operations that could be performed remotely chose to allow their employees to work from home, at least part -time.  As companies look forward to a time when conditions improve and they ar e allowed to reopen their doors, they must consider new regulations that have been put in place, as well as new working hours and methods. Remote work is defined as work performed away from the traditional office.  Instead of commuting to a company- owned location, employees can work from their home, a coffee shop, or any place where communication (internet) is available.  This study will evaluate the remote work strategy adopted by HealthcareSource, a software development company, and will explore the different issues that their employees face when working from home.",utc.edu,University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,United States,35.0459,-85.2953
34,GOVERNMENT-ENTERPRISE COLLUSION AND PPP EXPANSION IN CHINESE CITIES,@tju.edu.cn,"Public-private partnership, government-enterprise collusion, OLS model, GWR model","Public-private partnership (PPPs) have played an important role in China’s infrastructure financing, which aims to release the government’s fiscal press ures and improve the infrastructure’s quality. However, within the rapid development of PPP model, China’s PPPs bring increasing financial burdens on local government. This paper attempts to explain this situation from the perspective of government-enterprise collusion and puts forward policy suggestions. This paper collects the data of PPP projects and the individual information of mayors in China’s prefecture-level cities in 2018. Using  both classical ordinary least squares (OLS) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, this paper investigates the effects of collusion between local government officials and enterprises on PPP project development. The empirical analysis suggests that, after controlling for officers ’ and cities’ characteristi cs, officers with local working experience prefer to launch more PPP projects than foreign mayors. The total paper is of great policy significance for the current PPP project launch of local government in countries like China. Keywords Public-private partnership, government-enterprise collusion, OLS model, GWR model Introduction Public-private partnership (PPP) has been adopted and developed as one of the most important approaches to provide infrastructure projects. To relieve the financial burden and  promote economic growth, Chinese Central Government advocated PPP since 2014 (Wang, Xiong, Wu, & Zhu, 2017). Large investment amount and long operation period are two main characteristics of PPP. The implementation of PPP requires long cooperation between the local government and private sector. Private sector is generally responsible for the public services according to the contracts, and gain interests based on different payback mechanisms, including user-based payment, government -based payment and hybrid payment. To attract private partners, some local governments provide guarantees for the invest return rate of the infrastructure project through two payback mechanisms: government-based payment and hybrid payment. Within the fixed and guaranteed invest return rate, the incentives for the private sectors to improve the project efficiency are limited. Until Sep. 2020, the total number and invest amount of existing PPP projects are 9740 and over $2 trillion, separately. Besides, the number of PPP projects adopting government-based payment and hybrid payment are 93.8%. Therefore, PPP projects actually changed into local government’s illegal borrowing and financing vehicles, and eventually transferred to local government’s debt. Even Chinese Central Government enact many guidelines and regulations to restrict and standardize PPP projects, this situation still remains. This kind of PPP projects boost short- term economic growth and provide promotion prospect for the local officer, but leave a lot of debt for local government and following officers in a long period. The long- term reciprocity between local government and private sector can be regarded as a kind of “government-enterprise collusion” behavior, that is, through PPP projects, considerable short- term economic growth and fiscal revenue are achieved for the local government, and the local government promises certain invest return to the private sector. Government-enterprise collusion is common all over the  world. Without effective supervision of the central government, local government officers and enterprises are motivated to generate collusion alliance (Shleifer & Summers, 2013). Then the aim of collusion alliance is to achieve their own interest more prior than the public welfare. This has resulted in great waste and mismatch of public resources and brought down the social efficiency (Kolstad & Søreide, 2009; Sun, Song, & Xia, 2020). With the frequent contact and long-term relationship, local government and private sectors in PPP projects also own the motivation to generate collusion alliance. In November 2017, MOF enact one of the strictest regulations to standardize PPP projects and take a clampdown on unqualified PPP projects.

35,MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK FOR MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (MBSE),@vt.edu,"Model-Based Systems Engineering, Digital Engineering, Performance Measurement","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an increasingly accepted practice in the Systems Engineering community, however, little has been done to empirically show that MBSE provides value. Furthermore, as the industry continues in the direction of digital transformation, MBSE will become a critical component of the larger Digital Engineering (DE) approach. This paper presents a measurement framework for selecting and developing appropriate metrics to assess the value/ benefits of MBSE and subsequently DE. Utilizing expected benefits identified in a review of MBSE literature, a causal map was hypothesized to show how expected benefits (potential metrics) influence and relate to each other. This was done in order to  systematically determine which benefits would be the most impactful to measure. The hypothesized causal model was presented to subject -matter experts from the Digital Engineering Working Group who provided feedback and validation for the model. Based on the causal map and subsequent analysis, we can recommend the first metrics to be employed for DE/MBSE based on the most influential nodes of the causal model. Keywords Model-Based Systems Engineering, Digital Engineering, Performance Measurement Introduction Systems continue to grow in complexity, and with that growth comes greater difficulty in managing the development of these systems (DiMario, Cloutier, Verma, & 200 8). The utilization of models to design systems is increasingly considered a principle of good system design (Bahill & Botta, 2008). Model -Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) may be conceived as  “the formalized application of modeling” to the systems engineering process (Friedenthal, Griego, & Sampson, 2007). As an emerging field, the MBSE  literature boasts of the many benefits organizations can expect to achieve if the approach is implemented pr operly (Barbedienne et al., 2015; Friedenthal & Burkhart, 2015; Kretzenbacher, Lange, & Harvey, 2017; Long, 2008) . However, evidence shows little attention to formally measure these benefits (Henderson & Salado, 2021) . Systems Engineering (SE) as a discipl ine has historically had difficulty providing quantifiable evidence of its value, although those familiar with the SE process attest to intuitively understanding its benefits (Honour, 2004; Sheard & Miller, 2000) . MBSE, as a subset of SE, appears to be following that same pattern. Transitioning from a document -based to a model -based approach to SE represents a substantial financial investment, and organizations want to know if the effort and cost to adopt MBSE is worth it. However, lack of perceived value is commonly cited as one of the leading barriers to adopting MBSE (Cloutier, 2015; Huldt & Stenius, 2019; Lu, Wen, Liu, Gürdür, & Törngren, 2018; McDermott et al., 2020; Motamedian, 2013; Vogelsang, Amorim, Pudlitz, Gersing, & Philipps, 2017) .

36,INHERITING A DESIGN BUILD PROJECT: LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 2021 STUDENT STEEL BRIDGE COMPETITION,@mail.mil,"Engineering management, project, risk, schedule, COVID.","Each year the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) runs the Student Steel Bridge Competition (SSBC). A competition which challenges teams to design and build a small-scale steel bridge with a large set of requirements and scoring criteria. The United States Military Academy (USMA) takes part each year but the 2020 SSBC was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancellation resulted in the 2021 USMA Steel Bridge Team inheriting the 2020 team’s design and some of their fabrication. Inheriting the bridge forced the designers and team managers to make decisions on how to best posture the team for  success with limited knowledge of the design and fabrication. Which raised the question of what engineering management (EM) tools are the most valuable when inheriting an engineering project. As commercial projects vary in length, and do not always maintain the same team throughout the project life cycle, aspiring project managers must be prepared to inherit partially completed projects. Treating the 2021 SSBC as a case study, the USMA Steel Bridge Team’s systems engineers collected data, recorded observat ions, and took surveys to figure out which EM techniques were the most useful to the team. The team determined that the most important techniques were to develop an in- depth risk assessment, detailed scheduling, and monitoring and controlling. These tools of management were useful because they could be easily tailored to an ongoing project. Keywords Engineering management, project, risk, schedule, COVID. Introduction The cancellation of the 2020 SSBC, and the mass exodus of students going home for virtual learning, left teams across the country with unfinished competition bridges. Because of the cancellation of the 2020 SSBC, AISC allowed university teams to inherit the unfinished bridges. For the cadet team at the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, we decided to take advantage of this ruling and take on the in-progress bridge from the 2020 team. The 2021 team consisted of 5 Civil Engineering majors who focused on the technical aspects of the design and fabrication of the bridge, along with two cadets from the Department of Systems Engineering (DSE) who served as the technical project managers and decision-makers for the team. DSE teaches project manage ment and systems thinking through principles of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and the Systems Decision Process (SDP) (Parnell, 2011, pg. 17). Since we inherited a pre -designed and partially fabricated bridge, the technical project managers had to determine which tools from our education in DSE would best posture the team for success. Using the 2021 SSBC as a case study, the systems engineers for the USMA team applied the SDP and found which tools were most valuable when inher iting a project. We used the project manager functions of monitoring and controlling, risk assessment, and scheduling. Risk assessment forced us to think through scenarios, mitigate risks, and exploit opportunities. Monitoring and controlling paired with scheduling in an iterative way for this project, as we were constantly adjusting our schedule to fit our fabrication abilities and speed. We will first discuss the bridge design to develop an understanding of naming conventions and basic technical aspects o f the bridge. Then through the SDP, we will explore where, along the process, we inherited the bridge and how this informed what tools we used the most.",mail.mil,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Based on the author's experience in leading distributed teams, the need to enhance team performance is identified as critical to success. Also, with the switch to a ""New Normal"" work environment, there is increasing use of distributed, remote teams. The researcher conducted a systematic literature review in the areas of agile software development, teams, and distributed teams. Results of the systematic literature review are provided and include the taxonomy of factors, sub-factors and variables. Engineering Managers may use this paper to understand the dynamics in their distributed teams. Engineering Management Researchers may use this paper to help identify the important factors focused on distributed software development team performance. Introduction Every project is governed by cost, schedule, and technical constraints, commonly known as the Iron Triangle, Project Management Triangle, or Triple Constraint Theory. Given this, every project is a compromise. Spend more money or less, make the project more technically sophisticated or simpler, shorten or lengthen the time to deliver the desired features the customer is paying to receive. Businesses continuously evaluate methods of productivity , identifying barriers to success, to deliver more in less time for less cost. With software development projects becoming more complex than ever, many businesses are looking to reduce their labor costs while creating products faster. Some companies are looking to build the product using cheaper labor, while others go global to find an available and qualified workforce. Regardless of the initial reason, labor or workforce, and what is being created, the businesses need their teams to succeed. Too often these teams fail over a short period of time. The successful usage of globally distributed software development teams has proven difficult for many companies in many parts of the world. With an idyllic goal of reducing labor costs and developing software on a continuous cycle, the panacea of globally distributed teams (GDT) has proven to be elusive (Ghafoor, Shah, & Rashid, 2017). GDT, for the context of this paper, refers to any distributed development team that is separated by space, buildings, states, or time zones. The idyllic goals of cheap labor and continuous development are elusive primarily because team performance is multidimensional. It is based on unique people and therefore results in  unique teams. The dimensions that make up the team’s ability to perform are directly tied to each team member’s personality. The person-fit to the team impacts the cohesiveness of the team and the overall team performance (Driskell, Salas, Goodwin, & O’Shea, 2006). Significant variables such as trust, knowledge of business, skillset knowledge, development process, continuous integration/continuous deployment, automated testing, and other essential factors influence team culture and performance. A scrum team's (a sub-team to the whole development team) individual performance impacts the other teams in a similar but aggregate way as each individual impacts the scrum team. The scaled development team (the set of scrum teams), working together or distributed, contribute to the quality, on-time, on-budget delivery to meet the customer's needs. The degree of alignment of the team of teams governs the overall project performance or success. We have all seen teams that cannot get anything done, and we wonder where the problem lies. If you have ever seen high-performance teams, they can be amazing. Regardless of the team’s current performance, understanding what governs performance is key to identifying, monitoring, and correcting issues. Experience gained from more than 25 years of software development and management demonstrates that many factors control and influence the success or failure of a software development project. External influences, such as unmanaged change to current scope of work, may ruin a project. Poorly written contract vehicles may ruin a project. Misaligned customer expectations may ruin a project. These conditions are regular and significant influences impacting a software development team and the success or failure of the project. Internal factors may also contribute to project failure and include everything from",knights.ucf.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Engineering Management Researchers can use this paper to help identify the essential variables focused on distributed software development team performance. Introduction March 2020, the world stopped being normal. What we thought was just two weeks working from home became a much longer arrangement. Beginning in January 2020, we started a new internal research and development  project. Our goal was to build the minimal viable product (MVP) as a re-architecting effort of the core product in our division. This effort mapped to the strategic plan and roadmap of our division. In March, a bit over two months into our efforts, everyone was sent home. W ith the distractions of our home, our family, and the negative news in general, questions regarding the team’s productivity flew to the forefront of our minds. One team member, engaged earlier in 2019, postponed his wedding. The couple rearranged their plan to marry in a small, quiet ceremony on Pi Day, March 14 . Their honeymoon was postponed, rescheduled, canceled, rescheduled again, and canceled again. Their honeymoon is now scheduled for later in 2021, and we are all hopeful t hey get to take that trip. The team watched the couple navigate through turbulent pandemic times, suffered with them, supported them, and ultimately bonded through the shared experience. Another team member adopted a puppy right as the shutdown began, an adorable black labradoodle. As the team locked down, we got to see the puppy grow via video meetings, bark to go out just as someone was about to present, or bark at someone walking by the house. With all of us in similar situations, we laughed, were embarrassed together, and bonded through the shared experience. As the product owner on this agile software development team of about nine, the following observations are from the leader’s seat. This paper, a case study for the “New Normal,” is based on a  building theory approach to research. With over 25 years of experience in software development and software project management, this case study combines development experience, knowledge from academic research into Globally Distributed Teams , and identified key factors from literature. The research data and theories therein are viewed through the lens of the internal software development program to produce the shaping hypotheses (Eisenhardt, 1989). There is a wide variation in factors found in the literature for a given team or distributed team. However, literature research does consistently consolidate to a set of team practices. The consolidated team practice factors of Process, People, Organization, Technical/Project, and Leadership characterize a team’s contribution to the overall team performance, as shown in Exhibit 1 (Park, 2021). Exhibit 1. Consolidated Team Practices to Deliver Value. Process Observations The Process factor for team practices includes methodology and structure around the agile framework used to develop software. This includes meetings and activities such as the  daily standup, user story management, code reviews, closing user stories, and demo at the end of iteration.

The major efforts include COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and social distancing. This study has focused on COVID -19 testing which is the costliest, but the most essential operation and it is exclusive ly the responsibility of the universities. As such, it is worthwhile to look at ways to improve the testing procedure used at campuses. For instance, analyzing how to decrease the cost associated without compromising the reliability of the testing procedur e; or increasing the number of the testing with the same budget, etc. As a case study, we analyzed the COVID -19 testing procedure at Clarkson University currently testing 300 students a week to sample the prevalence on campus and attempt to stop COVID -19 at its source. While it is a good start, the question rises whether Clarkson is leveraging its resources in an optimal way. Throughout this analysis, pooled testing is looked at as a viable option to reduce cost or be able to test more students at the same cost. Keywords COVID-19 Testing, Academic Institutions, Pooled Testing Introduction Over the course of 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic has changed the daily lives of many people and institutions. One group that is particularly affected is universities and colleges. COVID-19 has affected most university processes including the delivery of course material, the social climate of universities,  the rules surrounding dining and residential living, and so on . Additionally, COVID-19 has pressured the economic oper ations due to the change in processes (“The Impact of Coronavirus,” 2020) .  As some small, private, non -profit post -secondary institutions are already struggling financially (Butrymowicz et al., 2020) , dealing with COVID-19 on campuses in an efficient and effective way is vital for these institutions to keep their doors open. The issue surrounding post-secondary education institutions and COVID -19 is twofold. On one side, if colleges remain open, they need to implement costly precautions to keep the student  body, faculty, and staff safe like surveillance testing, adapting the classrooms and lecture halls to meet safety regulations, and provide PPE and sanitary supplies. On the other hand, if students learn entirely remotely, the school is at risk of losing substantial amounts of revenue through room and board (“Trying to curb COVID-19 on campus,” 2020). Additionally, colleges taking an in- person approach were at risk of needing to close their campus if COVID -19 were to spread throughout the campus community. This could result in wasted money through the preparations of making the campus COVID-19 ready and potential reimbursement of room and board costs while ultimately putting the members of the campus community at risk through contracting the virus. Colleges and universities witnessed this firsthand when trying to make the appropriate decisions on how to run their Fall 2020 semesters. Most colleges had some form of in person classes whether primarily in person, hybrid, or primarily online, while only about one in ten colleges opted to be fully in person (“COVID-19 Data Dashboard,” n.d.). As of November 19th. 2020, the New York Times reported over 321,000 cases of COVID-19 at over 1,700 campuses (The New York Times, 2020) .

40,HYBRID PROJECT MANAGEMENT MODELS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,@gmail.com,"Hybrid Project Management, Hybrid Methods, Systematic Review.","Project management has always been seen as a guide to develop products and services efficiently, ensuring that task handling is aligned with the organization's strategy. However, companies have been challenged by the market in matters such as delivery spee d and high level of customization -  as a consequence of Industry 4.0. Initial project management models - defined by predictive characteristics -  have been gradually replaced by agile models, which were seen as ideal for newer scenarios. Nevertheless, after years following an agile-oriented trend, the companies are still facing challenges over efficient delivery and quality, either within agile or predictive models. Furthermore, frequently managers have to decide between agile or waterfall models for leading their projects, but always making a trade-off. As a result, most recently, project managers have applied best practices from both main models simultaneously, creating a hybrid context to project management. The main goal of this work is to analyze the evolution of project management hybrid model approaches in the literature to understand how researchers have studied and supported the depolarization of project management (agile vs waterfall). As a result, it is possible to notice clear evidence of studies being made in hybrid project management, confirming practical strategies applied in the industry. Keywords Hybrid Project Management, Hybrid Methods, Systematic Review. Introduction In the 70s, due to the product industry evolution, the waste and low efficiency of development processes boosted managers to seek for using new practices to obtain competitiveness. The need for planning and controlling the whole development raised a new era for product development by applying methods and measuring indicator s of quality and performance. Consequently,  that way of working was defined as a project, with peculiar characteristics that differentiate it from a simple operation: it is an effort to create or modify a specific product or service, being a temporary work with a clear beginning and end. To support all these changes, the industry began to hire professionals with such pragmatic and structured knowledge to ensure the application of implementation phases, the project managers. Subsequently, Project Management Institute  (PMI) was created aiming to compile management best practices. For a long period, project management was seen as a tool that required technical training and, alongside the organization’s internal processes, it could avoid the main problems associated with cost, scope and schedule. Hence, many authors cooperated with the emergence of the PMBOK Guide, which became a reference to organizations in different segments, sizes and locations. Even with its flaws, project management as defined than was a huge ally to project handling for many years - establishing that temporary effort along defined scope and cost would result in a product or service. Frequently in the 90s, the initial enthusiasm over project management was questioned, influenced by the effects of globalization and its demand for high performance. During this time, secondary areas of a project were heavily affected by market competition reaching a global level and straightening operational margins. Project managers questioned the correct applications of best practices and how could they solve roadblocks with more flexibility.

This research focuses on the use of deep learning algorithms to increase the accuracy and timeliness of flash flood predictions. Historical rainfall and Geographic Information System (GIS) data are used as inputs to a set of deep learning models. These models are then trained using historic flash flood event data to capture relationships between the weather and geographic data. Greene County, Missouri is used for this study as it encounters several weather events that have at times led to flash flood events. A risk analysis study is performed using this data to advance the current flash flood management strategies for the region. The data-driven approach is applied to publicly available data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Weather Service (NWS). Keywords flash floods, deep learning, neural networks, flood risk, Missouri. Introduction Flash flooding events have been responsible for significant losses over the last few decades. In addition to economic losses, these events have also been responsible for damage to infrastructure, traffic disruptions, and several fatalities in the affected areas (Ashley & Ashley, 2017). To efficiently deal with the damage caused by flash floods, it is vital to locate flood -prone locations and determine the likelihood and consequences of these events so that flood risk management protocols can be determined t o ensure public safety. In addition, locating these locations will assist the city planners and local agencies such as the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and Missouri State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) in restoring the infrastructure e lements damaged due to flash flooding, improving post-disaster relief operations for the well-being of the affected residents. Literature Review Research has been conducted over the last few years to identify  the flood-prone locations and gauge the economic losses incurred by the local stakeholders due to flooding activity. Hydrological models based on LISFLOOD software are used to develop a European Flood Forecasting System (EFFS) and  predict values of vital flood parameters such as water depth and inundation extent  (Roo et al, 2010). To improve the existing flood warning protocols , hydrologic one-dimensional and two -dimensional flow models are proposed which can estimate both flood travel time and inundated areas in a risk -prone region (Ghimire et al, 2020 ). Various researchers are also relying  on computational intelligence methods to locate flood-prone locations and improve current flood warning and risk assessment protocols. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used to identify the time at which a swollen river might overflow its banks and cause flooding in the surrounding areas (S & S, 2020). Machine learning algorithms such as Alternating decision tree (ADT), functional tree ( FT), kernel logistic regression (KLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) are implemented to efficiently map the location s prone to flash flooding events and update corresponding watershed management protocols  (Janizadeh et al, 2019) . Particle swarm optimization (PSO) based models are developed to predict flash flood-prone locations and update flood susceptibility maps in Northwest Vietnam (Bui et al, 2019 ). Other research teams have taken research endeavors to calculate  the economic losses associated with both seasonal and untimely  floods. Direct economic damages incurred due to flooding are assessed by a team of German researchers to find areas of improvement that could  improve the critical processes of flood risk analysis and management ( Merz et al, 2010 ).

42,INNOVATING SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT THROUGH ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCES,@csun.edu,"Supply Chain, Entrepreneurial Competencies, Corporate Entrepreneurship, Intrapreneurship, COVID -19","While Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a well -established field within the engineering management domain, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed problems and uncertainties for manufacturers that source materials and components globally. Such pandemic related disruptions and unpredictable demand patterns are rendering pre- pandemic best practices of SCM obsolete due to the volatile and complex interconnections between suppliers and the logistics of goods movements. The authors of this article propose that SCM and demand management be viewed through an entrepreneurial lens. Therefore, research is needed to identify which aspects of global supply chain management have the greatest need for transformation and that could benefit most through the application of entrepreneurial competencies. This proposed research model includes a mapping between SCM process steps and entrepreneurial competencies along with proposed training and organizational changes to facilitate the implementation of such changes.

During this timeframe, corporations have turned increasingly to global suppliers for their needs due to which the complexity of getting the raw materials / components together for the actual manufacturing and then delivery of a pro duct to the customer  or end user  has really gotten a lot more complex. Additionally, since March 2020, the COVID pandemic has also added layers of complexity to the global supply chain, which were fairly complex to deal with, even pre -pandemic. The global pandemic combined with rapidly changing economic conditions and technological change, requires greater flexibility in the overall supply chains and also on the part of the companies that comprise the supply chain.

Among many approaches for agile project management (APM), some are extensively applied in different sectors, while others remain almost exclusive to software development and similar fields. In this article, we try to better understand how APM is performed outside of IT projects based on a case study of agile management application in the engineering fiel d. Through interviews, data is collected and qualitatively categorized inside of Nicolini’s five dimensions of practice (work and efforts, materiality, agency and creativity, knowledge, interests and power) applied to APM’s context. The case itself describ es a team inside of a multinational company from the automotive field that reestablished the governance over the tool disinvestment process of the company using agile methodologies. This article seeks to understand what APM practices are used inside of manufacturing projects and, in order to do so, uses traditional project management practices as comparison criteria. Finally, some APM practices are easily identifiable inside the case, while others were clearly restricted by organizational factors and, even though considered important practices of APMs, could not be applied in the case in question. Keywords Agile Project Management, Manufacturing, Agile Manufacturing. Introduction Until recently, talking about agile methods for project management referred only to IT projects. Lately, we have seen an increase in the application of this methodology, making it easier to find it in several other segments. Among these segments, we can see the applicability of agile methods for project management within the automotive industry. Today there are studies that have made it more accessible to understand agile methods for project management, highlighting the importance of empirical issues and their use in practice (Stettina and Heijstek, 2013). The purpose of this article is to understand the adherence of agile project management methods within the automotive industry. The study will take place through the observance of a case study through the vision of those who participated effectively in this type of project. Some of the biggest challenges perceived in the practice of agile project management methods are related to the difficulty of aligning and adhering to existing processes, and the commitment, management and allocation of resources. These challenges can be mitigated  by characteristics generally observed in projects that are managed through agile methods. These characteristics involve the alignment of coordination, involvement, and ease of planning (Stettina and Heijstek, 2013).  For the literature, agile project teams  take on many traditional project management responsibilities. When this statement is observed in a sample, it is possible to perceive a high degree of autonomy, stable teams, and divided responsibilities. Through the lenses of agile portfolio management, Stettina and Heijstek (2013), identify three characteristics that are common  in the literature in a team orientation perspective: commitment, transparency and  collaboration. Speaking about transparency, the literature considers as common characteristics a portfolio for the entire organization, other initiatives grouped in the portfolio and strategic backlogs.

A major lesson from the pandemic incident is that global communities are more entwined, and globalization has come to stay, though pace may be slowed but it cannot be reversed.  As global energy sources transits from fossil -fuel dominated system to energy system that accommodates renewables in the mix, both local and global dimensions will become significant in policy formulation and decision making (especially in areas such as energy security, inequality, climate change, economic growth among others). Global trade in energy is increasing, and with advent of renewable resources, the trend is expected to continue. To manage this trend during energy transition, energy producing, and consuming countries must forge enhance cooperation especially in policy formulation and implementation  - to ensure energy security for all stakeholders. Increasing disparity in wages and inequality gap will compel national governments to pursue policies that promotes energy transition with economic empowerment through deregulation, decentralization, and digitization. Engineering managers will play pivotal role in the effective implementation of such policies –  ensuring seamless interactions of processes (including infrastructure developments that facilitate environmental and economic benefits for all stakeholders). This paper will examine energy transition from the perspective of local content and globalization. In addition, interacting variables, and conflicting dimensions (energy security, climate change, inequality among others) will be discussed. Opportunities (global and regional) for engineering management within the context of energy transition will be highlighted. Overall, the objective of this paper will have been achieved with appropriate awareness  created for the engineering management community about opportunities within energy transition. Keywords Energy Transition, Decarbonization, Democratization, Digitization, Globalization, Renewables. Introduction Emergence of COVID-19 over the past several months  have influenced decisions on energy transition globally, and almost all stakeholders (governments, industries, various institutions etc.)  are now setting net zero carbon targets. According to international renewable energy agency (IRENA – see references below), energy transition is a pathway toward transformation of the global energy sector from fossil-based to zero-carbon by the second half of this century. And the main driver here is the concerted effort at reducing the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy activities. Prior to the advent of the pandemic in early 2020, there are ongoing dialogue within the global energy sector of the need to decarbonize, digitize and decentralize - or what I termed the 3-D journey. At the core of these efforts is energy security – though not at any costs, rather at affordable cost; allowing both the supply and demand sides to continually contribute to economic growth positively. Advent of the pandemic may have exposed the benefits (and challenges) of remote working and business operations; end of the pandemic will not likely lead to end of remote working and or business operations. Instead, it is envisaged that remote working and business operations will be integrated into the future of work –  this is outside the scope of this paper and discussions will be deferred to another time. However, energy transition trends are being accelerated through both action and or inaction of key stakeholders and, rhetoric and action may be slowly converging. Events such as adverse climatic conditions with impactful consequences on human lives, are providing data points for relevance of coordinated approach to energy transition (from fossil fuel).  Even with this recognition, global inequality at nation-state levels have created different challenges on fairness and equitability in energy transition strategies. These challenges were recognized by IEA (see references below) in its recent report: Net Zero by 2050 – A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector. An excerpt from the report is stated below.

45,DEVELOPMENT OF A CAUSAL MODEL TO EVALUATE FACTORS IN PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION,@cofc.edu,"Performance measurement systems, implementation, Success factors, Causal loop diagram, Case studies","With increasing complexity in our systems, performance measurement (PM) is one of the strategic management tools that is being increasingly adopted to accomplish organizational goals and objectives. PM systems are developed in four phases- that is, design,  implementation, use and review phases. The implementation phase is dependent on the design phase and influences the use and review stages, respectively ; consequently, this phase is prone to more challenges than the other phases. Therefore, investigating the dynamics of success factors is important for the overall benefit and execution of PM systems. Since PM implementation  systems have no way to measure the inter - relationships between success factors, system dynamics (SD) is proposed to augment this shortcoming. SD thinking and tools appl y a holistic perspective to complex systems for diagnosis and decision -making by analyzing the relationship between factors. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop the causal relationships of success factors using data from published case studies. The relationships identified will be beneficial for managers and decision - makers to adopt management strategies that help manage resources better and continue to gain a more comprehensive perspective of behaviors  for an increased understanding of PM system  implementation. This will also provide a foundation for future work focused on  validating the model to  increase the effectiveness of PM imple mentation initiatives. Keywords Performance measurement systems, implementation, Success factors, Causal loop diagram, Case studies Introduction Organizational performance measurement (PM) systems provide frameworks and processes that organizations can adopt to meet their strategic goals and objectives for continuous improvement and competitive advantage (Taticchi et al, 2010; Bititci, 2016). PM systems also provide a holistic perspective for organizations as they consider both financial and non-financial viewpoints that give significant insights into operations (de Waal, 2002). Due to the ever changing business and global environments fueled by technological developments and globalization, organizations are looking to effectively design, implement and adopt processes that will ensure their success and survival  (Abernethy et al, 2021). PM frameworks provide the lens with which organizations can recognize elements  in their systems that will drive and sustain the strategic priorities (Melnyk et al, 2014). Therefore, PM frameworks have been increasingly adopted over the years by organizations.  PM systems are also being adopted across different industries including academia, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation services (Oladimeji et al, 2020a). Although the potential benefits of PM have been highlighted in previous literature (Bititci et al, 2012; Franco - Santos, et al, 2012; Bititci et al, 2018) and the successful adoption of PM has been increasing, organizations still face challenges with the implementation of PM frameworks. The increased adoption of PM has not necessarily resulted in significant success of adopted frameworks (Nudurupati, et al, 2011) and literature suggest that the implementation phase of PM has a significant role to play in t he success of PM initiatives (Keathley and Van Aken, 2013).

Systems Statistical Engineering research seeks to integrate causal Bayesian hierarchical modeling (Pearl, 2009) and cybernetic control theory within Beer's Viable System Model (S Beer, 1972; Stafford Beer, 1979, 1985) and the Complex Systems Governance framework (Keating, 2014; Keating & Katina, 2015, 2016) to produce multivariate systemic models for robust dynamic systems mission performance. (Cotter & Quigley, 2018) set forth the Bayesian systemic hierarchical constraint propagation theoretical basis for modeling the amplification and attenuation effects of environmental constraints propagated into systemic variability and variety. In their theoretical development, they simplified the analysis to only deterministic constraints, which models only the effect of statistical risks of failure. Imprecision and uncertainty in the assessment of environmental constraints will induce additional variance components in systemic variability and variety. To make causal Bayesian hierarchical modeling more capable of capturing and representing the imprecise and uncertain nature of environments, we must incorporate rough or fuzzy functions and boundaries to model imprecision and grey boundaries to model uncertainty in constraint propagation at each system level to measure the overall impact on the organization variability and variety.  This paper sets forth a proposed research method to incorporate rough, fuzzy, and Grey set theories into Systems Statistical Engineering causal Bayesian hierarchical constraints modeling. Keywords Fuzzy Hierarchical Systems, Causal Bayesian Hierarchical Models, Systems Statistical Engineering . Introduction Many of the world's most challenging statistical problems are large, complex, and unstructured. Statistical engineering has been proposed to guide the integration of multiple statistical methods to address these large, complex, and unstructured problems (Hoerl & Snee, 2010) . Statistical engineering was initially defined as: "" The study of how to best use statistical concepts, methods, and integrate them with information technology and other relevant disciplines, to achieve enhanced results. "" (Hoerl & Snee, 2010) . It involves the integration of statistical thinking (often at the strategic level) with the application of statistical methods and tools (at the operational level). It has the potential to provide the missing tactical link that will drive the proper application of statistical methods based on a solid understanding of statistical thinking principles. Statistical Engineering typically involves the appropriate selection and use of multiple statistical tools integrated with other relevant tools into a comprehensive approach to solving complex problems. In literature, (Cotter, 2012) summarized previous studies that led to the proposal for statistical engineering, identified the gaps in knowledge that statistical engineering needs to address, explored additional gaps in knowledge not addressed in the prior works, and proposed a working definition of and body of knowledge for statistical engineering. In this paper, the author mentioned that rapid development in statistics and quality management cause failure to contribute to both academic and industrial domains. Quality experts do not seem to be using the latest published research, and scientists do not sufficiently inscribe the potential problems experienced by practitioners.  In addition, (Cotter, 2012)  stated that it is vital to verify that the empirical statistical model correctly represents the physics of the practical problem definition and validates the model 's predictive capability against actual systemic problem behavior. In other words, the closer the empirical statistical model r epresents actual systemic behavior, the more accurate and precise its predictive capability.",odu.edu,Old Dominion University,United States,36.8862699,-76.30972478839735

The increasing serious environmental problems caused by consumption of fossil fuels make a strong case for transitioning to clean energy sources, which are less harmful to the environment. In this paper , the authors will conduct an overview of the literature related to changes in renewable energy (RE) demands and risk factors such as market, policy, technology and public acceptance as a result of COVID- 19 pandemic, and the emerging opportunities for clean energy transitions under the new policies being implemented, which support RE improvements. This study, by virtue of creating an overview of opportunities for renewable energy in a post-COVID world, could help build confidence and establish a knowledge b ase among decision makers for deployment of low -carbon technologies and fuels (renewable energy), as part of the recovery plans for a post COVID economy. Keywords energy transition, renewable energy demand, risk mitigation for renewable energy, causal loop diagram, COVID-19. Introduction Renewable energy (RE) has shown strong resilience during the COVID -19 pandemic, although many renewable energy manufacturing facilities, supply chains, and companies have been affected by the crisis and investors are concerned about the rate of return and risk of investment (Hosseini, 2020) . However, it is interesting to note that the share of RE has not decreased during the pandemic, which was a time when all the other sources of energy saw a decline in demand. To quantify this phenomenon, the authors would like to note that more than 260GW of renewable energy capacity was added globally in 2020, beating the previous year record by almost 50 percent  (State of Green, 2021). As primary energy demand dropped nearly 4% in 2020, global energy -related Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell by 5.8% the largest annual percentage decline since World War II. Last year , the International Energy Agency (IEA) began to track energy demand and CO2 emissions trends on a monthly basis. According to them , emissions in the United States fell by 10% in 2020, but after hitting their lowest levels in April and May 2020, they started to bounce back. What happens to energy demand and emissions in 2021 and beyond, in a post COVID world, will depend on how much emphasis various governments put on clean energy transitions, in their efforts to boost their economies (IEA, 2021). As a result, in this paper, the autho rs have discussed the primary effects of COVID -19 related to renewable energy, including ways to potentially address them as well as considering the risks that may come into play while doing so. To set the world on a pathway towards meeting the aims of th e Paris Agreement, energy-related CO2 emissions need to be reduced by a minimum of 3.8% per year, from now until 2050 (IRENA, 2020). President Biden committed the United States to cutting emissions by half by the end of the decade at a virtual Earth Day summit  (Sengupta & Friedman, 2021). The focus of this study is to identify challenges and opportunities in RE sources, caused by various outcomes that have occurred due to COVID-19. Changes in energy demand and overall energy markets may cause acceleration in green energy transition. Selected insights from relevant literature will be discussed in this paper.  The authors have also included a causal loop diagram (CLD), which has been established for illustrating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RE demand and consumption.

49,DECISION ENGINEERING: TIME AS A PARAMETER IN THE ENTROPY DECISION RISK MODEL UTILITY (EDRM-U),,"Decision Engineering, Risk Perception, Risk Aversion, Subjective Probability, Objective Probability, Endowment","Time is an important parameter in decisions made under uncertainty but is often not modeled in risk analyses. This research considers time effects upon decisions in the past, present, and future by incorporating the effects  of prior outcomes, decision pres sure in the present, and hope that a chosen outcome will remain valid (future utility, endowment, or reliability). According to Jeremy Bentham, utility theory is made up of four factors: magnitude, proximity, certainty, and time. So far, the Entropy Decisi on Risk Model Utility (EDRM -U) has addressed the first three factors by deriving the relationship between objective probability (relative certainty) and subjective probability (proximity), and demonstrating the validity of expected utility as the measure of magnitude in decision-making under uncertainty (behavioral economics, positive decision theory). EDRM-U also identified the measure of risk perception in terms of risk aversion and sensitivity. This follow -on research will introduce time as a parameter t o both risk aversion and risk sensitivity elements of EDRM -U and then consider  methods to validate and apply the new model. The goal of this research is to further the field of decision engineering by properly modeling all four dimensions of utility to acc urately predict risk choices, permitting better choice design or decision maker calibration to achieve desired outcomes. This research will ultimately impact engineering management by advancing understating of how people make decisions involving uncertainty to more closely align risk analysis and management tools with decision- maker expectations. Keywords Decision Engineering, Risk Perception, Risk Aversion, Subjective Probability, Objective Probability, Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, Gain Affection. Introduction Time has a profound impact upon the making of decisions , as all decisions are affected by prior information and the uncertainty of future outcomes, not to mention pressures in the present. However, most risk analyses don’t account for the deci sion maker by taking a  purely normative economics approach. Because of this, the effect of prior gains and losses, the urgency to make a decision in the present, and perception of the future are not properly accounted for in decision analyses. There is no other purpose for analyzing risk than to inform decision making, so risk models must account for the decision maker. The Entropy Decision Risk Model Utility (EDRM -U), built upon the Entropy Decision Risk Model (EDRM), presents a straightforward decision m odel validated against nearly a dozen prior behavioral economics studies to predict decisions and quantify risk perception (sensitivity and risk aversion) for individuals or groups (T. J. Monroe, M. G. Beruvides, & V. G.  Tercero-Gómez, 2020a; T. J. Monroe, M. G. Beruvides, & V. G. Tercero-Gómez, 2020b). Up to now, this research has generally assumed time is not a factor  to isolate other effects, but the work has advanced to the point that it is nec essary to update the model to account for the effects of time.  Other foundations have already been  laid to relate EDRM -U to the programmatic cost -time S -curve and to connect  the fields of behavioral economics and thermodynamics (Monroe & Beruvides, 2019, 2021). Starting with utility theory Monroe, et al., constructed EDRM and EDRM -U using the basic definition of utility offered by Jeremey Bentham in 1789 (Bentham, 1789; Monroe, 2021; Monroe et al., 2020a).

TN Tech Faculty teamed with online education experts on campus to develop a program that would meet the stated needs of the surveyed constituents. Surveys targeted three groups of constituents: engineering alumni, employers of TN Tech’s graduates, and members from several advisory boards within the College of Engineering. TN Tech program developers concentrated on the most requested aspect of the program: Engineering and Technology Project Management. Another key feature was to integrate several fundamental TN Tech Masters of Business Administration (MBA) online courses into the MSEM program. The program was designed for all asynchronous, online courses, via cohorts started each year. The program was approved by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission in July 2019 for a Spring 2020 start date. Because of a delay in hiring a program coordinator, the first of the MSEM engineering classes were developed and launched in Fall 2020. This paper presents details and challenges of the development, curriculum integration, online technology issues, future plans, and preliminary student responses from the first year of the TN Tech MSEM program. Keywords masters program, engineering education, curriculum development Introduction Herein is described the planning, development, and launch of a new, online, graduate program in engineering management at Tennessee Tech University (TN Tech).  The Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM) program was launched as a completely onli ne and asynchronous program of study, with courses offered collaboratively between the College of Engineering (COE) and the College of Business (COB).  The degree provides early-career, technology -oriented professionals with leadership, management, and tec hnical knowledge that will expand their career opportunities and add value to their organizations  (Bruce & Oswalt, 2018) . The origin of the MSEM program is different from that of many Engineering Management masters online programs, in that other programs were designed around existing courses or at least existing Engineering Management or Industrial Engineering departments. ( Kazemersky & Alp, 2000; Motavalli et al., 2005 ; Dusseau, 2014) This originating agency concept is common, though for Engineering Management programs, the courses may be interdepartmental or cross-disciplinary.

Thus, the  MSEM program is conducted out of the  General and Basic Engineering (GBE) department, a n engineering department that previously had no graduate programs or class offerings under its purview.  However, the GBE department did have some ongoing experience in hybrid online classes, in that it offered a Bachelors of Science in Engineering (BSE) program with many of these classes being hybrid -online.

This research involved tracking load data for the building for a calendar year, developing a deterministic optimization model for battery operation and recommending load c hanges for the building. Initial attempts at modeling involved mimicking existing battery performance in terms of discharge/charge rates, as well as constructing basic operational parameters to make the model easy to use and modify on an as -needed basis. Over time, the model was continually revised as more data became available. Based on the final model, operational guidelines were created for the most efficient battery settings to maximize economic savings for a billing period. When combined with the elim ination of excessive loads, the deterministic model’s optimized settings showed that the installed 14.25 kWh battery could yield annual economic savings while operating at efficiencies above 90%. Combining the battery with solar PV increased savings throug h avoiding grid outages, resulting in potentially thousands of additional dollars in savings.

This concept emerged from technical improvements in almost every sector, such as manufacturing, medical, business, agriculture, education, and other essential aspects of a country’s economic valuation. As a result, the human lifestyle has improved dramatically as the industry 4.0 concept enhances the productivity, innovation, automation, and betterment of humankind. This concept has converted production,  logistics, and management into a digitalized format, which helped us to create a vast network of communication, trade, business, automation, and intelligent secured lifestyle (Pereira et al., 2020). In the sense of continuous improvement (Kaizen), some countries are evolving from Industry 4.0 to Society 5.0 as part of a paradigm shift. As the usage of significant technical applications, Japan is advancing its whole operations into Society 5.0. Japan focuses on an intelligent smart human-centered society to integrate cyberspace and physical space (Minchev & Boyanov, 2018).

This issue causes delays in on -time delivery for customers receiving built connectors forecasted through the distributor. This paper aims to establish the root causes of forecasting -built connectors on MRP and how to improve those processes. Establishing the root causes in the process required data to be collected from product managers, salespersons, and supply chain managers. Data was collected through surveys, individual interviews, and MRP reports obtained by supply chain managers. The data collected pro vided insight into a few key issues for the distributor. The process of how built connectors are forecasted and assembled was not clear amongst those interviewed. The data also showed that the connector assembly group is allotted three weeks to build connectors forecasted on MRP. The standard lead time for connectors not on a forecasting program is five days to build. The interviews provided significant details on how product managers allocate components to work orders. Any disruptions in the supply chain can negatively impact delivery on built connectors for MRP customers. The results signify a need for the distributor to establish a process map to forecast and build connectors on MRP. The lead time for building MRP connectors in connector assembly becomes an issue when fluctuations occur in a customer’s forecast.

The connector assembly group, situated in the main warehouse assembles connectors for military, government, and private-sector operations. Customers can purchase fully brokered connectors from the manufacturer through the distributor; however, connector assembly offers significant customer cost savings with smaller minimum order quantities. The distributor also offers customers programs to automatically replenish products they procure through AIM, Advanced Inventory Management system.

This research identifies and discusses previous studies on the justification of MBSE. The goal of this research is to understand how the systems engineering and engineering management communities perceive MBSE and what aspects of MBSE are valued. Over 1,900 quotes from 60 academic sources are coded to determine the attributes that describe MBSE positively, negatively, or neutrally. Aspects of MBSE that are perceived to be positi ve include: verifiability, consistency, reasoning, and communication. Aspects of MBSE that are perceived to be negative include: approach understanding, cultural acceptance, and cost to implement. This research provides an understanding of perceived benefits and disbenefits in published literature that practitioners can use to conceptualize the value of MBSE in their own applications. Keywords MBSE, model-based systems engineering, systems engineering, value Introduction Differentiating a fad from a parad igm shift can be a significant challenge for engineering managers. The choice whether to try a new approach on an engineering project can result in improved or worsened budgets, schedules, efficiency, safety, and morale. Systems engineers and engineering m anagers are facing this question with regards to adopting MBSE. To make this decision even more challenging, the engineering projects that are supposed to gain the most from MBSE are high stakes and difficult to experiment on. To begin to expand beyond he uristic discussions of the value of MBSE, we gather over 1,900 quotes with perceived positive and negative aspects of MBSE from 60 publicly accessible academic sources with varied study types. We aggregate the perceived positive and negative attributes of MBSE to provide a formalized understanding of what is perceived as valuable about MBSE. A study on the adoption of MBSE found that practitioners could not identify which aspects of MBSE contributed to the expected benefits (Vogelsang et al., 2017), indicat ing that identifying positive and negative aspects of MBSE in our study will offer significant progress towards understanding the value of MBSE. This study focuses on understanding what aspects of MBSE are perceived positively or negatively, rather than suggesting MBSE is valuable, as many previous studies have. We address the following research question: What attributes and impacts of MBSE are perceived positively or negatively in literature? Background Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is defined by INCOSE as “the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities.

With the globalization of food supply chain , and agro -food and pharmaceutical logistics, effective and efficient cold chain has become a necessity. As shelf life of perishable food products is greatly affected by temperature condition, cold chain is essential to preserve and transport the foods in the optimal product - specific temperature range for slowing down biological decay processes. Thus, cold chain ensures the maintenance of food safety and minimization of food waste. Cold chain has also become a n essential component of global pharmaceutical logistics with the increased production of vaccines in the past decade. Refrigeration requirements for vaccines are more stringent than many perishable food products; therefore, a robust cold chain is needed in pharmaceutical industry. This study  compares the sustainability and challenges of cold chain system  in the United States and India.  Through the comparative analysis, recommendations are provided to address the challenges and improve the performance of the cold chain system. Keywords Cold chain, Supply chain, Shelf life. Introduction Supply chain management is a set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufactures, warehouses and stores for timely production and distribution of merchandise while minimizing system wide costs and satisfying service level requirements ( Shabani, Saen, & Torabipour, 2012; Simchi -Levi, Kaminsky, Simchi -Levi, & Shankar, 2008; Wong & Wong, 2007). One of the branches of supply chain management is cold chain management. The cold chain involves logistics of temperature-controlled perishable merchandise such as perishable food items (for example, fruits, dairy, vegetables, meat  and seafood) and perishable pharmaceuticals (for example, vaccines ). With the globalization of food supply chain, and agro-food and pharmaceutical logistics, effective and efficient cold chain has become a necessity. As shelf life of perishable food products is greatly affected by temperature condition, cold chain is essential to preserve and transport the foods in the optimal product-specific temperature range for slowing down biological decay processes. Failing to keep perishable food in the desired temperature range can stimulate the growth of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms  and make it inedible ( Mercier, Villeneuve, Mondor, & Uysal, 2017 ). Consumption of inedible food, due to unknown or unreported safety risk, cause foodborne illnesses. It is esimtaed that 1 in 6 Americans get sick from contaminated food or beverages each year, 3000 die, and it costs more that $15.6 billio n each year (""CDC and Food Safety,"" 2018) . When insufficient refrigeration of persishable food in the cold chain is known and reported, the food is discarded, considering food safety, which results in food waste. It is estimated that the food waste in the United States is between 30 -40% of the food supply (""U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Waste FAQs,"" 2021) while 1 in 8 Americans struggles to put food on the table  (""Natural Resources Defense Council: Food Waste,"" 2021). Most wasted food ends up in landfills where it generates methane (a greenhouse gas that is upto 86 time more powerful than carbondioxide) raising environmental concerns ( ""Natural Resources Defense Council: Food Waste,"" 2021). While cold chain system is essential to improve safety of persishable food, to reduce food waste and to mitigate environmental concerns raised by food disposal, energy is required to maintain the cold chain. The generation of this energy contributes in greenhouse gas emissions (James & James, 2010). Cold chain systems generally use  high-GWP",northeastern.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
56,COOPERATIVE GAME THEORY FOR AMBULATORY CARE,@sdsmt.edu,"Game Theory, Ambulatory Care, Cost Sharing","There are currently three distinct entities involved in providing ambulatory care: fire departments, hospitals, and EMS agencies. In game theory, these entities are players that are not currently in full cooperation with each other. Establishing a system, or game, in which these players are in full cooperation would provide cost savings to all three players. Combining the overhead and variable costs of providing ambulatory care between fire departments, hospitals, and EMS agencies is more cost effective then each of these entities being financially independent. Keywords Game Theory, Ambulatory Care, Cost Sharing Introduction Fire departments, hospitals, and emergency medical service (EMS) agencies are the players providing ambulatory care to patients in need of emergency medical treatment. These entities are players that are currently not in full cooperation with each other and could benefit from a cooperative game theory model. A cooperative game theory model could identify a coalition wherein some combination of these three players share costs in such a way that reduces the overall expenses associated with providing ambulatory care. The purpose of this paper is to use game theory to identify ways in which ambula tory care can be made more affordable. By identifying how these players can save money by sharing costs, emergency medical patients will also benefit from more affordable care. This use of game theory would help to combat the rising cost of ambulatory care by encouraging the players involved to work cooperatively. The three players involved in the game are defined as the set N = {P1, P2, P3}.  These three players together form the grand coalition as defined in the following equation. P1 = Fire Department, P2 = Hospital, P3 = EMS Agency N = {P1, P2, P3}                    (1) There are then 6 subsets of the grand coalition which then make up the set K as defined in the following equation. Each coalition in K will have a unique cost assigned to it, allowing each coalition to be compared to the grand coalition and each other (Shapley, 1953). K = {(P1), (P2), (P3), (P1, P2), (P1, P3), (P2, P3)}     (2) In K, (P1), (P2), and (P3) represent fire departments, hospitals, and EMS agencies working independently, as they currently are. (P1, P2) represents the fire department and hospital working cooperatively with each other and will have a unique cost that differs from that of (P1) and (P2). (P1, P3) represents fire departments and EMS agencies working cooperatively and (P2, P3) represents hospitals and EMS agencies working cooperatively. In general game theory, each coalition (Sn), including the grand coalition, has a cost assigned to it by the characteristic function of the game. Each cost, c(Sn), is a specific value unique to each coalition (Shapley, 1953). This type of game is known as an n-person cooperative game where there are always 2(n-1) coalitions of more than one player. A coalition means that the players involved will be working cooperatively and no longer be treated as separate entities. Players involved in a coalition share costs and resources with the other players of the coalition, providing a lower cost to each player then if they were to be working independently.

To fight this devastating subject, women in Turkey rely heavily on restraining orders for violators, supplemented by an inclusive law of 6284. However, even with the law in usage, the system fails to protect its citizens where an increasing trend for femicides is observed each year. In this context, systematically elaborating and understanding the institutional system's deficiencies of restraining order implementation, stand as an urgent research topic. Since engineering management frameworks can offer valuable tools for systemic analysis and interpretation of regulative system failures, this study discusses how engineering management approaches like Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) can provide insights into social problems. By adapting FMEA on a critical social issue, namely domestic violence, and scoring each of the failure causes according to their “occurrence”, “detectability” and also “severity of their adverse effects”, the requirements framework for domestic violence prevention policy and action design processes are determined after a ranking process. Findings from FMEA revealed no established detection system exists for most of the systemic failure causes in Turkey. The majority of system deficiencies, in other words, improvement points, occur during the operational phase. Hence, the study points out an emergent need to establish an effective risk assessment system and enhance communication channels among stakeholders. Also, it shows how engineering management approaches such as FMEA could provide an overall and integrated view of the social problem and institutional practices' pitfalls. Keywords Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), domestic violence, restraining order, institutional system design, engineering management in social context Introduction In recent years, there is a very crucial and obtrusive matter all over the world: Femicide. According to the UNODC's last Gender-Related Killing of Women and Girls Report (2019), 87.000 women were killed maliciously all over the world in a year while 58 percent of them had been killed by their intimate partners or acquaintances. When examining Turkey, numbers of femicides have not been shared by the government since 2014. The biggest data source about this subject is provided by a non-governmental organizat ion named We Will End Femicides Platform. The platform collects all of the news about femicides in Turkey and periodically launches them to inform society. When the annual reports from this platform are investigated, it is observed that over 2000 women had  been killed by men in a total of 5 years with an increasing trend in the last years (2020). The reports also show that most intimate partner murders are based on a long history of violence and happen due to women wanting to end the relationship. An important issue that needs to be addressed in violence against women is that, to a remarkable extent, it has been observed that the suspect in the violence incidents is known by the victim or was the victim's intimate partner. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner are exposed to violence (WHO, 2013). Restraining orders are the most common way to prevent violence against women. Nevertheless, 11 percent of women have been killed despite the restraining orders. About one- fifth of them were killed within 2 days after the restraining order and almost one- third of them were killed within a month.

The demand for pa ssenger air transport decreased dramatically during the pandemic due to international and domestic travel restrictions, whereas cargo transport experienced an unsurprising increase. This paper studies the impact of COVID-19 on US domestic airlines in two c ategories: Legacy – American, Delta, Southwest, and United; and Cargo –  FedEx and UPS. Analysis of the financial performance ratios and changes to these, both pre -pandemic and during the pandemic, is conducted and the financial performance is analyzed in f ive major categories (e.g. liquidity, leverage, efficiency, profitability, and market value ratios). This paper also reports empirical comparison results between financial performance of passenger and cargo airlines. The data for analysis is obtained from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Wharton Research Data Services, and Yahoo! Finance. The results in this paper may be valuable for airlines and other air transport providers as they seek to understand pandemic response/behavior, or make decisions to increase their resilience.

Keywords Airline financial performance, financial ratios analysis, COVID-19 impact on financial performance of airlines. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the airline industry (Cherney, 2021). The pandemic has adversely affected the passenger travel demand and capacity (IATA, 2021a), whereas the cargo demand has increased during this time (IATA, 2021b). The decrease in passenger travel is due primarily to the travel restrictions, State - or City -wide lockdowns, and the health risks associated with COVID-19. The unsurprising increase in the cargo transport is due to restricted in-person access and personal choice to potentially reduce the chance of COVID-19 exposure. Coronavirus disease or COVID -19 is an infectiou s disease caused by coronavirus, officially known as SARS - CoV-2 virus (World Health Organization, 2020). According to American Journal of Managed Care  (AJMC) (2021), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first coronavirus cas e in United States on January 21, 2020. On February 2, 2020, global air travel was restricted and on February 3, the US declared a public health emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak (AJMC, 2020). Since then, COVID -19 has adversely affected a wide swath of sectors, communities, and industries globally. In this paper, the researchers study the performance of US-based domestic airlines during COVID-19. The scope of the research is limited to six publicly traded airlines listed on US stock exchanges .  The four passenger airlines in this study are American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines; the two cargo airlines are Federal Express Corporation and United Parcel Service. The research is focused on three major performance areas – passenger and cargo level, stock prices of airlines, and five categories of financial ratios of the airlines (profitability, liquidity, efficiency, leverage, and valuation. The researchers aim to empirically compare and present the performance changes of passenger and cargo airlines prior to and during the COVID-19 time period.

This study uses the “flexible requirements planning” (FRP) framework to develop and apply a multiproduct aggregate production planning model (M-FRP-APP) to assist planners in a telecommunications company to manage plant stability and plant cost simultaneously. The telecommunications company handles a unique combination of production planning challenges concerning machine assignment, setups, product priority, safety stock requirements, and post-processing options while valuing overall plant stability. Furthermore, they face high demand uncertainty due to the nature of the telecommunications indust ry and their shipment agreements across a wide array of products. The results are compared with traditional a multiproduct APP (M-APP) model through both planning cost and plant stability measures of performance. This comparison indicates that the M -FRP-APP model performs better in these metrics and allows for potential applications outside of the specifics defined within the case study. Keywords Aggregate Production Planning, Flexible Requirement Profile (FRP), Multiproduct Planning, Plan Variability, Telecommunications Introduction Within the production environment,  a main objective is to  reduce the costs of operations  while meeting customer demands. This is achievable through appropriate planning procedures such as aggregate production planning (APP). APP aims to determine optimal quantities for production, workforce, and inventory levels a company will need over a selected planning horizon to meet demand for products that share the same resources (Cheraghalikhani, Khoshalhan, Mokhtari, 2019). Additional interest s of a manufacturing company include tracking, planning for, and limiting the effects of nervousness and uncertainty regarding the production environment. This uncertainty can come from the demand forecast, the internal or external supply process, general logistics and globalization of the market, and other areas that are not concrete within the planning process. These uncertainties can create nervousness within the company that cause frequent changes in production plans potentially add ing unnecessary expenditures and creating stressed environments. Traditional techniques, such as frozen horizon, safety stocks , and change cost procedure, have been used to stabilize production planning, but as discussed in Demirel (2014) and Torabzadeh and Ozelkan (2021), these methods may not allow for the required flexibility a plant needs to meet demand.  Flexible requirement profiles (FRP) , as introduced by Demirel , Ozelkan and Lim,  (2018), has been shown to  manage plan stability through dynamically changing flexibility bounds on the production quantities and solve some of these disparities from traditional methods. For a single product planning problem and using experimental data, it has been shown that FRP can be incorporated into an APP mathematical optimization formulation to reduce instability and nervousness by limiting plan fluctuations to a level the company finds acceptable while also meeting demand (Demirel, 2014; Demirel et al., 2018; Torabzedeh and Ozelkan, 2021).

The complexities of today supply chain mana gement systems have led to ineffectiveness across the entire value chain and causes delay in transaction and lack of trust between client and organization across the world. The advent of emerging digital technologies such as blockchain has introduced a distributed digital ledger technology that provides traceability, transparency and security, and thereby addressing one of the major supply chain problems. Blockchain technology and digital supply chain have been identified as highly promising technology that is working together to revolutionize industries  of the future. Blockchain is gaining the attention of both industry and academia and this has led to the emerging of different research across different domains such as additive manufacturing, healthcare, production management, automotive, supply chain, etc. However, there is still a gap in literature around digital supply chain and little research have been conducted. This paper focuses on the application of blockchain in supply chain in the digital age. This paper reviews the current position of blockchain business across different sectors and the supply chain management and strategy for emerging technology based on recent Gartner’s market research report.

In the process industry, manufacturing performance constitutes a source of compet itive advantage. To achieve a higher level of manufacturing performance, the condition of equipment becomes a key determinant  (Kans & Galar, 2016) . Maintenance influences equipment condition, its performance and the applied str ategies have been evolving since early times of breakdown maintenance, through pro -active strategies such as Condition Based Monitoring (CBM), Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and to more recent Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). The WCM approach incorporates technical pillars to advance maintenance practices for sustenance of equipment performance, manifesting through zero defects, zero harm and zero breakdowns.

Reliability and availability of equipment is cogitated as a key benefactor to profitability and performance of manufacturing maintenance system (Bakri et al., 2014). Bottani  et al (2014) state that an inefficiency of an equipment can brings unsolicited consequence in profit and productivity in the organization. These consequences are instigated by various factors including but not limited to a slow data flow, improperly defin ed business processes, and inaccuracy of a raw data. Traditional maintenance management is challenged by manual data handling that in numerous occasions can lead to inability to handle the 21 st century’s complex and everchanging increased customer demand.  Mining and manufacturing industries continues to search for maintenance system impending a reduction of downtime, an increase in reliability and availability of equipment through the most cost- effective manner ( Alabdulkarim et al., 2014).  The search for a proactive maintenance system incorporates an interest to discover modernisation of maintenance functions and operations that influence performance of mining and manufacturing facility today ( Bokrantz et al., 2020) .

64,CRITICALITY ANALYSIS OF AGILITY CRITERIA USING AHP AND PROMETHEE METHOD PUCPR,@live.com,"Industry 4.0, Agile, MCDM, Agile Team Evaluation","Performance assessment metrics applied to the production, sales and services are directed at all professionals in a company once they are active actors who play key roles in the performance indicators. Digital transformation is a fact. The advance in favor of companies with agile and smart processes corroborates  a cultural change in the professional working model where the knowledge of a specialist is no longer required, but a multidisciplinary mindset is set in place . That results in the employee adaptability to different work models according to the  company needs. This is one of the values in the agile manifesto, which preconizes that the individual must be valued by the organization, rather than machines and processes. This research proposes the agility perception assessment, based on the agile approach qualifying criteria and following the criteria preconized by a multinational automotive company considered in this study. To achieve this goal, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied to analize a pairwise relative of the criteria perception.  Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) is then used to cross the perception criteria with agile principles. The result is  a diagnostic view to compreehend the agility criticality of the participating employees, which belong to an engineering team. This analysis suggests that inefficient practices pointed should be left behind, while the efficient ones are reinforced, keeping the focus on the commitment to the employee recognition. Keywords Industry 4.0, Agile, MCDM, Agile Team Evaluation Introduction When speaking of Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, the context in which such terminology is applied must be measured, as it has become a term used on a large scale in educational and business contexts worldwide (Rajpurohit & Verma, 2016). Whereas new technologies are applied in order to produce more quality scale the context of digital transformation, new skills and competences of workers are required (Francisco, Santos, Loures, & Deschamps, 2020). In addition since the advent of the Agile Manifesto, created in 2001 by a group of people who wanted to implement a paradigm shift in the software development format, ther e is the desire of the human being to have a more relevant role in his profession than simply his work process, as ""individuals and their interactions are above processes or tools"" (Beck, et al., 2001) , giving greater evidence t o the worker than to work, although they are not independent of their environment (Wendler, 2014) In this scenario, chosen agility factors will be evaluated for diagnosis and verification of adherence. Thereunto, criteria extracted from the literature will be used, directly connected to agile principles and supported by Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods to better address the resolution of the research question. Theoretical Background The following topics serve as the basis for this study.  As this research  is founded on the Industry 4.0 and agile methodology themes, they  will be addressed in items 2.1 and 2.2 respectively;  and the item 2.3 will introduce the instrumental axis, with the elucidation of the methodologies used.

65,UNDERSTANDING MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIER ORDER ALIGNMENT IN A SINGLE SOURCING STRATEGY,@mines.sdsmt.edu,"Local, Produce, GAP, Supply Chain.","The purpose of this project will be to ascertain the demand requirements of an organization that operates in an economic environment wherein most of the purchase orders are made with a single local supplier. In such situations, successful fulfillment of th e order by the supplier is critical to the manufacturer’s success. The proposed study will seek to explore a two -player collaborative  game structure in order to design necessary incentives for cooperation between the manufacturer and a single supplier. The goal of such a framework would be twofold: to find a local source to assist in resource allocation , and to use this information to ascertain  if sufficient incentives for a single source platform exist. For t he proposed study, the manufacturer would be a food service organization such as a University Cafeteria and the supplier would be a food vendor that offers a unique local food item. Incentive mechanisms are built on existence of stakeholder interest and the ability to offer a novel product. To this end, a survey will be used to assess if consumers would like a locally sourced product. Keywords Local, Produce, GAP, Supply Chain. Introduction The purpose of this project will be to ascertain the demand requirements of an organization that operates in an economic environment wherein most of the purchase orders are made with a single supplier. The scope of the project is targeted in the Rapid City area in South Dakota. Local will be defined as being produced within 200 miles of where the product is consumed. The industry that was studied was bulk ordered produce needed by cafetierias and restaurants. This project was done with help from various entities on the South Dakota Sc hool of Mines and Technology campus (SDSMT). Primarily the interest of this project was to find out what was stopping farmers from being able to sell there produce in the whole sale market. Exhibit 1.

66,A VEHICLE-TO-GRID FRAMEWORK FOR POWER SYSTEM UNIT COMMITMENT,@uscupstate.edu,"Unit commitment, Vehicle-to-grid, Battery degradation, Plug-in electric vehicles.","The projected growth of plug -in electric vehicles on roads has the potent ial to produce challenges to the operational stability of power systems, particularly when a significant number of these vehicles charge and discharge concurrently. However, if plug-in electric vehicles in a vehicle-to-grid system are properly managed, they can be transformed from potential problems for the electrical grid to benefits. Some benefits from smart management of plug-in electric vehicles integration into the power grid include cost reduction and load leveling. This study describes a  preliminary unit commitment framework for a vehicle -to-grid system . The methodology incorporates controlled charging and discharging as well as battery degradation into the unit commitment problem. The framework described in this study is useful to engineering managers because it enables smart control of plug-in electric vehicle integration into the power grid which can lead to reduction in generation cost and leveling of the load profile. Keywords Unit commitment, Vehicle-to-grid, Battery degradation, Plug-in electric vehicles. Introduction Due to the alarming rise of global temperatures and the devastating effects of climate change on many communities around the world, the International energy Agency (IEA) has set a goal to reach net -zero emissions by 2050  (IEA, 2021b). According to IEA, the global population of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is expected to grow from 10 million in 2020 to over 115 million in 2030 (IEA, 2021a). Although increasing the number of electric vehicles is a viable option for reducing carbon emissions, mass adoption of PEVs , which are charged by plugging the vehicles into electrical power sources,  would introduce many challenges to existing power systems. The uncontrolled charging and discharging activities of large number of PEVs can significantly stress the power system causing major voltage fluctuatio ns and higher cost of operation (Rahmani, Hossein Hosseinian, & Abedi, 2021) . However, through smart management, PEVs can provide ancillary services to support the power system as distributed storage unit s. PEVs can be integr ated into the power systems as load and supply via v ehicle-to-grid (V2G). PEVs have the potential to operate as mobile storage unit s to store the excess generated power or to support the grid through discharging at the given times, resulting in lower cost of generation and higher load-leveling (Y. Wang et al., 2019). There are many studies on  the possible impact of high penetration levels of PEVs  on the electricity markets. Shamshirband, Salehi, and Samadi Gazijahani (2019)  studied the possible benefits of increasing the profits of PEVs owners to promote consumers to switch to PEVs . The authors proposed a multi -objective model to maximize the owners’ profits and minimize the operation cost. The results indicate that mass adoption of PEVs  has high potential of reducing greenhouse emissions and voltage instability while achieving significant profitability for owner s. In a study by Uko, Egbue, and Naidu (2020) , the authors incorporated V2G into the economic dispatch  (ED) problem to coordinate charging and discharging activities of 20,000 PEVs. PEVs were found to be effective in addressing demand-side problems and responding to frequency balancing. In addition, controlled V2G has been used to smooth load fluctuations (Kiviluoma & Meibom, 20 11), improve voltage stability in urban power grids (Lyu et al., 2020)  or offset the power uncertainty in renewable energy resour ces (M. Wang et al., 2017) .   Incorporating PEVs  in future power system planning is therefore inevitable  and can lead to the abovementioned benefits. However, discharging conditions in V2G mode can cause significant degradation to PEV batteries. Therefore, including battery degradation for PEVs involved in V2G is important to analyze the operation  of V2G systems from the perspective of consumers",uscupstate.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
67,AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO OPTIMAL DECISIONS FOR NEWSVENDOR PROBLEM WITH QUANTITY DISCOUNT AND ADDITIVE DEMAND FUNCTION,@uncc.edu,"Newsvendor problem, quantity discount function, pricing, price-sensitive demand, additive demand function.","The newsvendor problem is one of the primary problems of stochastic inventory optimization and has been studied widely in the literature. In this problem, typically the newsvendor (retailer) has to make a decision on pricing and order quantity given the stochastic demand and purchasing (supplier) price. In this research we address th is problem with a twist, the supplier price is not fixed and is rather based on order quantity.  The unit price decreases with order quantity and follows a given pricing function. Also , the consumers’ demand follows an additive function which is dependent on the retailer’s price as well as an exogenous random factor. Given these factors, the retailer has to decide on the retail price and order quantity that maximizes its profit. To solve this problem, w e develop an analytical approach to find the condition of the optimal results , based on these condi tions a simulation-based optimization method is proposed to solve the numerical examples. Keywords Newsvendor problem, quantity discount function, pricing, price-sensitive demand, additive demand function. Introduction The newsvendor problem is one of the classic stochastic inventory problems, where a retailer facing uncertain demand decides about joint purchase quantity and  pricing. Petruzzi and Dada (1999)  studied the optimal order and pricing decision in the newsvendor problem and provided conditions for the existence of a unique optimal price and order quantity. In this research,  we consider the newsvendor problem with a twist, i.e. the supplier uses a quantity- based pricing function (QDF) rather than fixed pricing. Unlike fixed pricing strategy where there is a set fixed price for a good regardless of order quantity, in quantity -discount based pricing, the unit price is dependent on order quantity, where commonly the unit price decreases with increasing order quantity. This change in pricing results in a more complex newsvendor problem to solve This function  is a decreasing function of order quantity q  which will be described in more detail in the next sections. We have developed a mixed analytical-heuristic approach to solving this problem which is based on relaxing the QDF by replacing it with a fixed price c and using the method developed by Petruzzi and Dada (1999) to solve the problem by proposing a 2-step simulation optimization algorithm to include the QDF from the supplier in the problem to find the numerical optimal solution . We will use this approach to study the effect of input parameters on the expected profit of the newsvendor,  further analysis will be provided in the next sections. As there is  an extensive number of papers  on the newsvendor problem, there are several papers t hat have studied problems very close to our research. Sarjono, Fernandez et al. (2020)  has studied a problem of a newsvendor facing quantity discounts and developed a multi-step method to find order quantity for this problem in the construction industry. Comparison of the  results to the real -world decision data  showed good performance  compared to  the traditional method in most of the cases. The research presented in the current study  differs from Sarjono, Fernandez et al. (2020)   since an analytical approach to the problem is utilized here, while Sarjono, Fernandez et al. (2020) use a multi-step method without proof of optimality or how the quantity discount pricing was considered in  the problem. Mohammadivojdan and Geunes (2018)  also studied the newsvendor problem with multiple capacitated supplier and quantity discounts, and proposed an interesting algorithmic approach based on the knapsack problem; their problem is also distinct from the problem at hand since  price-sensitivity of demand , as well as the optimal retail price are considered here, which is not the case in both of the papers mentioned above.",uncc.edu,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,United States,35.227085,-80.843124
68,EVALUATING THE FCC’S IBFS DATABASE: A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE DISH DOWNLINK LOCATIONS REGISTERED IN THE IBFS,@ieee.org,"geospatial analysis, satellite imagery, satellite downlink dish antennas, C-band, 5G communications, strategic analysis","The United States’ Federal Communications Commission explored repurposing frequencies currently used by C-band satellite uplinks and downlinks. Using a downloaded local copy of the entire database of nearly 13,500 locations for offline querying and analysis, custom subsets of roughly 3,000 to 7,000 locations each were generated for a segmented and comparative analysis.  Each subset of data was randomly sampled to produce a statistically valid representation of the entire subset, and then each of the roughly 350 samples in each group was reviewed visually using current and historical satellite and aerial imagery to quantify and qualify the errors in location accuracy for satellite downlink dish antennas.  The results were tabulated and analyzed for distance errors and qualification of common errors in submissions. This study analyzed the FCC’s database, quantifying and qualifying the accuracy and error types of the locations recorded to provide a basis for either validating or disproving claims of widespread inaccuracies and disuse, thereby enabling the FCC to make the best policy choice possible considering the actual usage of C-band frequencies in the United States.  The results of the study indicated areas of improvement to the new location registration process. Keywords geospatial analysis, satellite imagery, satellite downlink dish antennas, C-band, 5G communications, strategic analysis Introduction In the race to deploy broadband access to the Internet quickly and widely, the global wireless industry is planning how to grow beyond its current fourth-generation cellular infras tructure into the next -generation 5G service.  5G service will require wide swaths of Radio Frequency bandwidth, and the common challenge facing every nation wanting to deploy 5G is to find and allocate lots of high-performance radio spectrum for it. A large portion of the RF spectrum that is highly desired by the wireless industry has historically been  globally allocated to C-band satellite downlink use.  Claiming that C -band is severely underutilized and that current records are rife with errors and abandoned sites, 5G proponents petitioned the regulatory agency in the United States to reallocate some or all of the 500 MHz C -band frequency range to the 5G industry.  This would impact  the satellite industry and many other industries such as broadcasting that depend on C-band’s availability and reliability. The Federal Communications Commission is an independent governmental entity tasked with managing all radio communications in the United States (About the FCC , 2018).  The FCC uses the International Bureau Filing System database to track the locations of and current authorizations for satellite downlinks .  Because the FCC’s policy decisions should be fact-based, this study investigated the IBFS database’s accuracy, including both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the IBFS.  This study aims  to answer the question of whether the ava ilable data in the IBFS database is accurate and reliable enough to support making national policy decisions about whether C-band should be repurposed.  It describes a strategic approach to quantify and qualify the available data, assess the data usability, and it recommends changes to improve future data gathering and use. Background Information In 2018, the FCC proposed reallocating or sharing some or all of the 3,700 –  4,200 MHz C-band downlink spectrum currently used to downlink satellite communications signals, and it also sought to gather information regarding the current usage of C-band downlink frequencies.",ieee.org,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

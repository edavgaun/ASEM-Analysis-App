0,INTEGRATION OF MODEL BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND COMPLEX SYSTEM GOVERNANCE,@odu.edu,"Model-based Systems Engineering, Complex System Governance","Model Based Systems Engineering has emerged as a formalized modeling approach to support systems from conceptual design through the entire system life cycle. In MBSE, exchange occurs through models as opposed to documents. Complex System Governance is an e merging field focused on performance of nine essential functions necessary to assure continuing system viability (existence). This paper explores the intersection of MBSE with CSG to identify how these two approaches to complex systems might complement and perhaps enhance one another. Three primary aims of the exploration include: (1) a short overview of the central tenets and essence of MBSE and CSG, (2) identification of strengths, limitations, assumptions, and potential compatibility for joint deployment of MBSE and CSG for complex systems, and (3) opportunities for integration of MBSE with CSG to more effectively provide for design of complex systems that meet requirements, including interaction with the operational environment. The paper concludes with opportunities and challenges for further integration of MBSE with CSG. Keywords Model-based Systems Engineering, Complex System Governance Introduction To say that systems engineering is experiencing a dramatic shift is an understatement. While systems engineering has been successful in the past, there are challenges that continue to confound the directions of the field. In Exhibit 1, we identify seven pressures for the evolution of systems engineering for the future. Although each of these pressures can be explained independently, in reality they influence, and are influenced by , the other pressures. They have been designated as ‘pressures’ to acknowledge that their successful navigation will be important in charting the future directions for systems en gineering, and in particular the important role Model Based Systems Engineering  (MBSE) and Complex System Governance (CSG) will be challenged to support. 1. Uncertainty as a Driving Force. The fundamental aspect of uncertainty is that the precise cause -effect relationships cannot be known for complex systems. This challenges more traditional formulations of engineering complex systems that are dependent on ‘reduction’ or being able to reduce a system to the component level and apply the language of  mathematics to understand, and repeatably predict, performance. This assumes that a complex system can be objectively defined, explicitly represented, and fully known. 2. Complexity Increasing in Systems.  The essence of complexity is characterized by a large number of variables/entities, rich interconnections between constituent entities, dynamic behavior instituting changes over time, and emergence of behavior, structure, and performance as the system operates. 3. Information Expansion Accelerating.  It is not a  revelation that information is exponentially increasing. However, information is also challenging systems engineering with respect to veracity, trustworthiness,",odu.edu,Old Dominion University,United States,36.8862699,-76.30972478839735
1,ENGINEERING EDUCATION: RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT,@lsbu.ac.uk,"Engineering education, research skills, professional skills, pedagogy, case study r esearch.","Engineering education is anchored in developing skills and knowledge related to a core foundation across the areas of science and mathematics as well as  engineering analysis, design and practice. However, engineering students also need to acquire research skills for successful completion of the research project in the near -term combined with enhanced professional skills for more long- term development. The refore, this research study provides the insights gained from the delivery of a dedicated module designed to enable both research and professional skills development for masters level engineering students. The module is based on a unique combination of teaching content related to developing research skills (including the literature review process, research methods, data analysis and modelling, research ethics, research impact and relevance to sustainability) and content related to professional skills (including project management, systems engineering, engineering design, lean engineering and communication). The study includes a supporting literature review that identifies existing engineering education practices. Lessons learn ed and pedagogical insights are identified in regard to the design and delivery of the module, which should be of interest to those involved in the development of engineering education programs. Keywords Engineering education, research skills, professional skills, pedagogy, case study r esearch. Introduction The primary focus of engineering education is to develop the skills and knowledge related to a core foundation across the areas of science and mathematics as well as engineering analysis, design and practice (Philbin, 2020). Therefore, it is the responsibility of engineering faculty to educate students in order to become “ready to engineer”, which means they possess a deep knowledge of technical fundamentals and engineering theory as well as pre-professional engineering skills (Crawley et al., 2014). While this focus needs to be maintained, there are other emerging learning requirements, such as the need to include relevant material on sustainability; the fourth industrial revolution; relevance to employability; as well as adeq uate content related to the contextual application of engineering and corresponding understanding ( Hadgraft & Kolmos, 2020).  Furthermore, there are challenges to be addressed across engineering education in terms of improving the problem -solving and learni ng skills of students, developing soft skills (such as team-working, leadership and communication skills) as well as providing an understanding of enterprise related areas (Philbin, 2021) , such as innovation, entrepreneurship and business management ( Qamar et al.,  2019). These requirements can be viewed in the context of preparing engineering students for eventual employment so they are equipped with the necessary employability skills, termed ‘transversal competencies’ ( Cruz et al., 2020). According to a more holistic perspective of engineering education, it can be observed that engineering curricul a benefit from including teaching content related to conducting engineering research projects ( Baekgaard & Lystbaek, 2019) and improved information literacy (Feldmann & Feldmann, 2000). This includes understanding how to conduct a literature review; design of the research methodology; and an appreciation of data analysis and other related research skills and knowledge. This understanding is required for successful completion of masters level research projects and the subsequent preparation of the thesis, or dissertation (Host et al., 2009) as well as undergraduate capstone research projects ( Van Bossuyt et al., 2019). Therefore, engineering students need to acquire research skills for successful completion of the research project in the near -term combined with enhanced professional skills for more long- term development and employability prospects . This can potentially be achieved through the delivery of a dedicated engineering module (or class) that includes intra -curricular teaching material specifically designed to integrate  both research and professional skills and knowledge into engineering education programs. The structure of this article is as follows. After the  introduction is the literature review relating to research and professional skills development in engineering education.

2,AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR MANAGING INTEGRATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,@nps.edu,"Mission Engineering, Military Decision-Making Process, Technology Integration, Innovation, Adoption.","Barriers to technology integration into an enterprise are constantly present in engineering efforts. This paper discusses integration from the standpoint of mission engineering which emphasizes incorporating new capabilities to achieve desired mission effects . This viewpoint underscores the core nature of integration in mission engineering as  the operationalization of a system into an existing organization. As such, mission engineering integration goes beyond the amalgamation of components into a singular product; it highlights the complexities of system of systems. This paper introduces three phases of integration (transition, adoption, and diffusion), applies decisional survey methodology to examine technology projects from the Navy Environmental Sustainability Development to Integration program, and develops a mathematical model to inform decisionmakers about the likelihood that a proposed new technology will be integrated into the enterprise. Th is work offers engineers with a means to manage the integration of new technologies by first identifying highly integrable technologies. The scope of this work focuses on the second phase of integration, adoption . The contribution of this study is an analytic model to gage the likelihood of adoption  in mission engineering. As such, the methodology outlined in this paper may be applied to cons truct mathematical models for other phases of integration. Keywords Mission Engineering, Military Decision-Making Process, Technology Integration, Innovation, Adoption. Introduction In an increasingly budget-constrained environment, leaders in the Department of Defense (DOD) must make cost- effective decisions for selecting which requirements or capabilities to fund. The backdrop to many of these decisions is the rapid insertion of cutting -edge technologies from the private sector. These innovative and disruptive technologies offer great promise, but also present new risks when integrated into the target system. Due to these risks, the organization receiving the new technology may choose to not adopt the new technology, resulting in wasted time and resources. A failure to integrate a new technology into the enterprise occurs for numerous reasons. Thus, it is a primary objective of this study to d etermine which factors are critical for  successful adoption of new technologies . I n identifying characteristics of integrable technologies, the authors intend to help decision makers in their invest ment strategies. A key effort in this work is developing a mathematical model that quantifies the likelihood of a technology being effectively integrated into the enterprise. The following sections examines the Naval Environmental Sustainability Development to Integration (NESDI) as a case study  (Hernandez, Eldred, Khan, and Parker 2020) . In past years, NESDI leaders have witnessed an unsatisfactory proportion of funded technology projects achieve full integration into the Navy enterprise. The impetus of the study is to address NESDI’s need for a quantifiable approach to select candidate projects in which to invest. We describe the research environment at NESDI and the approach for gathering and analyzing data. Construction of the predictive model applies a logistics regression approach  using the JMP software to mathematically characterize the proposed technology solutions (Sall et al. 2007). The resultant expressions predict the likelihood that specific adoption measures will achieve high marks, which indicate that an organization will adopt the new technology.",nps.edu,Naval Postgraduate School,United States,36.598,121.875
3,RESULTS OF ROLE DELINEATION STUDY TO DEVELOP EXAM BLUEPRINT FOR CPEM AND CAEM CERTIFICATION EXAMS,@stcloudstate.edu,"Role delineation study, competency area, validation, survey, engineering management, certification, exam blueprint","A role delineation study is used to identify and validate the competency areas required to function in a job role in any discipline. This study aimed to validate the competency areas of the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK) and to obtain a blueprint of certifications offered by the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM). The EMBOK is a foundational guide for multi-level professional certifications– the Certified Associate in Engineering Management (CAEM) & the Certified Professional in Engineering Management (CPEM). Before this research, a study was conducted in 2014 that emphasized on delineating competency areas for all domains of the EMBOK. In the past 7 years, significant progress has been made in the discipline that has prompted the need for revalidating competencies in the Engineering Management domain. To collect comprehensive data, an online survey methodology was used to gather feedback from industry experts in the field of engineering management. The survey consisted of demographic questions followed by questions to rate  the importance of competency areas of all domains of the EMBOK. The respondents were also asked to include or exclude those specific domain areas in both CAEM & CPEM exams on a dichotomous scale. The competency areas were categorized based on the mean and standard deviation of the ratings. An exam blueprint was obtained for the certification exams and the competency areas in the EMBOK were also validated through the study. Keywords Role delineation study, competency area, validation, survey, engineering management, certification, exam blueprint Introduction The American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM)  is a globally recognized society that drives initiatives to promote development in Engineering and Management discipline which is receiving growing attention in the industry consistently. ASEM defines engineering management as “an art and science of planning, organizing, allocating resources, and directing and controlling activities that have a technological component” (Shah & Nowocin, 2019). ASEM offers two levels of professional certification: Certified Associate in Engineering Management (CAEM) and Certified Professional in Engineering Management (CPEM). Over the years, ASEM supported many aspiring and experienced Engineering management (EM) prof essionals to excel in the technical and management area. This is achieved through industry-recognized examinations of CAEM and CPEM which are essentially based on the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK) guide. The EMBOK is uniquely designed to serve as a framework for advancement in the field. However, in the past 7 years, the competency areas of the EMBOK were not validated . The revalidation of these competency areas was critical to bridging any gaps due to recent industry trends in the engine ering management field . This paper presents the latest process of validation of all the domains of the EMBOK . The following research questions were formulated to guide the study: 1. What are the existing competency areas that should be included in the CAEM a nd CPEM examinations?",stcloudstate.edu,Saint Cloud State University,United States,45.0667,-94.1667
4,FIRMS AND THEIR LIFECYCLE: CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPEDE THE LEARNING PROCESS IN HI-TECH MARKETS,@uqo.ca,"market lifecycle, clock speed, deep structure, surface structure, disruptive technological intrusions, hi -tech sector,","Learning is often an essential component and a predictor of a firm’s capacity to adapt and to survive in emerging markets. However, there are circumstances where a firm’s ability to learn and accommodate change is impeded, which could become a liability fo r long-term survival. Often the inability to adapt is overlooked by change management experts and those using learning as a strategic tool due to bias from cultural thinking; particularly when trends occurring in the market are complex and are not easily i dentifiable or discernible. Such complex scenarios will lead to market turmoil, which will obscure information from firms that could have been extracted from data and often produce market transients that are of low signal to noise ratio; thereby, undermini ng the learning process for firms. This article will explore the market evolution of firms and their lifecycle and will also examine classic failures in the learning process due to the mismatch of knowledge derived from learning itself with corporate leadership and/or corporate culture. Additionally, an explanatory framework based on the lifecycle concept will be used to identify market constraints imposed upon firms.  This article will further outline the two levels superimposed on the lifecycle core, which include the deep structure and the surface structure that can pose essential barriers and constraints for firms in relation to the learning process and to their long-term market survival. Keywords market lifecycle, clock speed, deep structure, surface structure, disruptive technological intrusions, hi -tech sector, learning process, learning failures. Introduction The learning process has very definite markers in the market and is a structured endeavor, but firms may fail to internalize knowledge derived from the learning process. Likewise, the market can create circumstances where firms are either limited or unable to generate and utilize appropriate knowledge from the learning process. This article will analyze three categories  that firms may face in the market, which represent learning failures; namely, the circumstances that constrain learning within firms, structures of the market that interfere with the learning process, and disruptive technology intrusions that prevent firms from learning.  Additionally, these types of failures can result or be compounded by a firm’s position in the lifecycle and obstacles that they may have in relation to the market. The examples used in this article are drawn from the hi -tech sector as the three possible categories that firms may face occur more frequently than in other sectors. Firms must be able to discern meaningful patterns from emerging changes occurring in the market, align and possess the ability to accurately interpret the meaning of environmental signals to meet the requirements involved with the learning process.  Firms will need to isolate these environmental signals from excessive background noise, which may be particularly  difficult if these signals are of low intensity . These environmental signals  can be too embedded in the noise background for firms to accurately identify them in a timely manner. Learning failures could be generated in this situation, which will undermine the capacity for firms to survive long-term in the market. If market related events are unfolding too quickly, firms may not be able to discern or anticipate patterns  quickly enough and this will result in their corporate decisions and responses being implemented too late for these to have a meaningful impact.",uqo.ca,Université du Québec en Outaouais,Canada,45.42226325,-75.73909824426678
5,SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS WATER INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT,@ttu.edu,"Infrastructures, Sustainment, Isomorphology, Water Resource Management","Concerns over both water quality and  quantity continue to increase around the world.  As the need for useable and potable water becomes more of a world-wide issue, there is an opportunity to review and consider alternatives to how water is used, consumed, and sustained for future use for the world's population.  Review of data across many cities within the United States shows opportunities for improvements  in water infrastructure systems.  Making small improvements throughout these systems would help increase the amount of useable water throughout the country. Using data provided from the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Water Audit Reference Dataset (WARD) and the Water Research Foundation (WRF), information is provided to define data driven opportunities to mitigate water losses throughout American Water Infrastructure systems. Variables and causes are identified which if improved, would make the most significant impact to better overall water system sustainment. Keywords Infrastructures, Sustainment, Isomorphology, Water Resource Management Introduction As the world population continues to grow, so does the concern of quantity and quality of water.  T he United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Water Research Foundation (WRF), and the American Water Works Association (AWWA) have made strides in developing and implementing methods to track, mitigate , and reduce water system losses within the infrastructure (EPA, 2010).  However, most U.S. states have not adopted many of these methodologies as a result of cost, lack of proper governance, and insufficient technical management (AWWA, 2016; Horbatuck, Burgess, & Beruvides, 2018; Rouse, 2013).  M any systems in place today are old, inefficient, and lack resiliency and sustainability.  T he action to implement improvements throughout these systems would help increase the amount of useable water throughout the country (Horbatuck, Burgess, & Beruvides, 2018). With the issue of usable  and available water being a focal point  around the world, more  research is being conducted to consider alternatives on how customers utilize the resource, specifically human consump tion (Fedler, 2017). In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 1 billion people world- wide who were without a reliable water supply (Fedler, 2017; Gleick, 2000). Given the continued growth of human population, the water availability per capita decreases, thus making the resource more scarce (Bohan & Horney, 1991). Using current water consumption rates and population projections, a sufficient supply of fresh water is available to support a global population of roughly 8.3 billion people, whi ch is predicted  to occur around the year 2030; while in the U.S., a population of about 390 million people could be sustained, and estimated to occur around the year 2045 (Fedler, 2017). As those date estimates grow near, action needs to be taken to help p repare for this near certain challenge of having available, usable water for consumption. The manner in which water is used and consumed today will be critical to population sustainability, and this matter extends beyond the shortages experienced by developing countries. Developed countries, including the U.S., are also facing shortfalls and a cultural mindset shift is needed to thwart the idea that water is a resource which is easily accessible and available for all to use and consume (Rouse, 2013). In the U.S., many communities are struggling to maintain their water infrastructure (Maya, 2018).  Opportunities exist to implement improvements in infrastructure systems, which would allow for more available, usable water.  An analysis of the 2017 AWWA State of the Water Industry report revealed that the renewal and improvement of the U.S. aging water and wastewater infrastructure is the top concern among water utility workers (Maya, 2018). The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 2017 Infrastructure Report Card graded the U.S. water and wastewater systems as D and D+, respectively, based on an A through F grading system with a D grade indicating “infrastructure is in fair to",ttu.edu,Texas Tech University,United States,33.59375255,-101.89959552302756
6,QUANTUM FORMALISM’S CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DECISIONS: THE IDENTIFICATION OF OPTIMAL STRATEGIES,@aui.ma,"Behavioral economics, Engineering design strategies, Optimal strategies, Quantum decision theory, Rationality.","In the traditional human decision making process, alternatives are assessed with regard to the rational objective needs of decision makers. However, exp eriments show that humans often make irrational choices and thus, several paradoxes, fallacies, behavioral and representative biases are identified. In this complex context, Quantum Decision Theory (QDT) is introduced as an effective alternative conceptual framework, which uses some elements of a quantum formalism to consider the complexity of a human decision making, in relation with risk attitude and in the presence of ambiguity and uncertainty. In order to highlight the strength of this theory and its significant usefulness, this paper presents two interesting frameworks. The first one is used for the identification of optimal engineering design strategies, under uncertainties, intention interferences, personal intuitive feelings and behavioral bases. The second framework concerns a general model of a dynamic optimization by a type indeterminate agent, to characterize generic personality types. Keywords Behavioral economics, Engineering design strategies, Optimal strategies, Quantum decision theory, Rationality. Introduction The identification of the decision maker’s needs represents the first step in any decision making process, and for which the goodness of any proposed solution is assessed with appropriate at tributes, related to identified needs and objectives. In addition, proposed solutions are pronounced through the corresponding value model and which ideally, asserts the rational choice of the maximum value as the optimal alternative (Amos and Sarchet, 1980). In this regard, major economic debates frequently evoke the rationality principle, which is considered as a central hypothesis in traditional economic theory (Denton, 1996). In fact, the attribution of the Nobel Prize of Economic Sciences to Arrow (Arrow, 1972), Simon (Simon, 1978), Becker (Becker, 1992) and Lucas (Lucas, 1977) reveals the importance of the rationality concept, in the sense that the rationality hypothesis represents the common evoked question, through the research and development works of all these aforementioned economists. Added to that, the irrationality is refused in widely publicized scientific debates and controversies. To name a few examples, we can evoke for example the stigmatization of the irrationality related to over indebtedness households or to the adventurous investments of some leading banks (Arrow, 1972). On one hand, some economists such as Von Mises ( Salerno, 1990) consider that rationality is inherent to human action insofar as all actions are intentional, and each actor will seek the most appropriate actions, to achieve its own objectives. On the other hand, the rationality for other economists such as Varela and Dupuy ( Dupuy and Varela, 2013) is only a hypothesis, which is linked to the history of the dominant econom ic paradigm and its related axioms. For this group of economists, the dominant view based on the postulate that behavior is explained by the identity, preferences, attitudes and beliefs, is hard to reconcile with the most  of experimental evidences (( Zimbardo, 1969), (Valins and Ray, 1967), (Schachter and Singer, 1962) , (Festinger and Carl smith, 1959), (Bem, 1972) and ( Coleman and Snarey, 2011)). In particular, faced with the same possibilities, an agent may make a different choice depending on the way in which the choice is presented to him, or in the context in which he is placed, whereas the different contexts seem equivalent to this choice. It is also possible that having to make several independent successive choices, the agent preference depends on the order in which these choices are made (( Zey, 2001) and ( Beresford, 2008)). Experiments show that the individual is not simultaneously endowed with preferences with respect to one subset of alternatives, in the sense that the individual behavior is not consistent with the existence of a complete ordering over the universal set of alternatives (Busemeyer and Pothos, 2012).",aui.ma,Al Akhawayn University,Morocco,33.5391007,-5.1067849505058565

Opportunities and obstacles in concurrent engineering practices at medical robotics's design, supply, and manufacturing phases are also acknowledged to evaluate industry stagnation that present challenges to furthering emerging technologies and processes. Additionally, discussion of an improved application of concurrent engineering manufacturing practices through case examples is proven. This study aims to review the difference in concurrent and serial engineering processes to find the most optimal form for product development in medical robotics manufacturing. Furthermore, through its three pillars, future recommendations and applications of concurrent engineering illustrate the encouraging effect on the medical industry through both a technological and humanistic approach. Current technologies on the market in the medical manufacturing industry are exemplified along with the authors' own experience having worked at suppliers of the assembly parts. Future investigations also seek to further both the subject matter and industry. With the proper application of concurrent engineering to technologies in the medical industry, medical breakthroughs can more rapidly be sought and achieved. Keywords Concurrent Engineering, Manufacturing, Design, Quality, Medical, Robotics. Introduction With an ever-growing industry seeded by public health, medical technology continues to push the boundaries of what was once seen as science fiction.  One of the most significant medical technologies to have come around are medical devices. ""The United States remains the largest medical device market in the world: $156 billion (40 percent of the global medical device market in 2017). By 2023, it is expected to grow to $208 billion. U.S. exports of medical devices in key product categories identified by the Department of Commerce exceeded $43 billion in 2018"" (SelectUSA.gov). As one looks back at the history of medical devices and technology, signs of advancing medical practices with these methods can be found in ancient Roman times, and even before. As ti me continued, the use of simplified tools such as medical gloves and thermometers emerged and became standard practice. However, the true revolution of medical technology began with the advent of 21st century technology, such as Integrated Circuit chips and embedded software. Heart monitors, pacemakers, medical testing, MRI, CAT scans, etc. have ushered in a biological reform of how humans perceive and heal the body. Where then, can technology take us next? The near future of the medical industry lies in the realm of medical devices and robotics. This may be as simplified as a replacement joint for a hip, or as complex as robotic- assisted surgery, and everything in between. The one commonality of this near-future medical industry is the reliance on manufacturing and engineering. As the bounds of medical practices are pushed further and further, so do the expectations of what is to be achieved through manufacturing and engineering. This, while seen as quite an ambitious venture, can also be perceived as a ben efit, as competition in both industries will advance technology faster and promote public health. Yet, to accomplish these goals, the manufacturing and engineering industry will need to examine how current production methods are accomplished and look to both fixes known process issues and improve wherever possible. Concurrent Engineering is one of the methods that are still underutilized in the industry. ""Concurrent engineering is an approach used in product development in which the functions of design engi neering, manufacturing engineering, and other departments are integrated to reduce the elapsed time required to bring a new product to market"" (Groover, 2019).

8,FIELD SERVICE QUOTING PROCESS IMPROVEMENT USING DMAIC,@astate.edu,"Field Service, Quoting, DMAIC.","It is widely understood that inaccurate quotes can lead to many issues within a project. The more accurate a quote, the higher the chance for project success in terms of financials. If a service does not have an accurate quoting process, it is difficult to track the success or failures of that service. Currently, field service quoting is based off a standard price per day and is multiplied by the length of the trip. This does not consider where the engineer is traveling and what the cost of living in that certain area may be. This can lead to issues within the project as it relates to overall project margin, determining project success, as well as management being surprised by the cost of the expenses. The objective of this study is to conduct a DMAIC process on field service quoting. The cost of room and board, food, and transportation varies greatly across the United States a nd the world. T hese costs can greatly affect the margin of the project and need to be accurately estimated before a trip. A more accurate field service quote allows for more consistent margins on field service trips, an area now where margins can vary significantly. A more consistent margin allows for better profit planning and a better understanding of project success or failure. By a pplying lean six sigma and the DMAIC process, the quoting process has become more accurate when compared with actual costs. Keywords Field Service, Quoting, DMAIC. Introduction Field Service is a major part of the Applications group  and health of the business. The Field Service group travels to customer sites to install, troubleshoot, and support hardware and software for industrial gas turbine power  generation sites. These trips can last anywhere from a day to months depending on the scope of work. Due to the length of these trips and the current pricing structure, field service trips are a great source of revenue for the business . With the revenue making a significant impact on the business, there tends to be scrutiny and attention on  project margins. Depending on the location of the trip, margins  discrepancies of allotted funding vs realized cost  have been known to vary greatly. These margins tend t o go unnoticed if they are more positive but are questioned if they move more in the negative direction. The goal for margin on field service projects is 62%  based on the company’s requirements for employee compensation and expense recapture. If a project has a margin higher than 62%, most of the time there is not much of an explanation for why the margin was higher than expected and upper level management is happy. If the project has a margin lower than 62%, project management , and the field engineers begin to get questioned on why expenses exceeded the daily limit. Currently , field engineers have a daily living expense  amount of $295 dollars a day. Although this may seem very high, when you factor in all the meals and expenses that an engineer on the road will incur, the total amount can exceed the daily living expense amount with ease. When costs exceed the daily living expense amount, the overall project margin begins to decline. Costs that a field engineer will have during a trip include room and board, transportation, and food. These expenses vary greatly depending on  the location of the project site and the time of year. Currently, there is no process to accurately determine the cost of living expenses based on different locations and times of the year. Implementing a tool into the field service quoting process that could accurately predict the cost of living expenses based upon location and time would more accurately predict project expenses . When an engineer travels to a more expensive location, this tool will better prepare management for the expenses that the engineer will most likely incur. For example, the estimated lodging per diem rate  from the GSA  in the month of July in Omaha, Nebraska is $110 a night versus San Francisco, California which is $270 a night. As this one example shows, the cost of lodging varies greatly, as these rates affect the margin, management needs to have a better idea of where the project stands before it is completed.",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513
9,OPTIMIZATION OF A PACKAGING STATION USING DMAIC,@astate.edu,"Packaging, Manufacturing, DMAIC, Lean, Engineering, Human Factors","The purpose of this study is to analyze the optimization of the packaging station at Fulfyld. One key tool that is used in determining how to improve the packaging station is to use DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement, Control). Using DMAIC will show  if there are any areas that Fulfyld can do to improve their company. Along with DMAIC, Lean Thinking and 5S tools were utilized when analyzing the process. Throughout this paper , there will be in-depth analysis of the current process, possible solutions f or creating a more efficient packaging process, and recommendations to enhance the process. Creating a more efficient process in packaging will allow for a lower labor cost per package, which will increase the margins for the company. It will enhance the team’s overall work experience and result in a more positive work environment while also creating a financial gain for the company. Keywords Packaging, Manufacturing, DMAIC, Lean, Engineering, Human Factors Introduction Fulfyld is an eCommerce fulfillment service for every step of the supply chain. Fulfyld integrates directly with ecommerce marketplaces and shopping carts to simplify the shipping process for customers. Fulfyld is considered a Third Party Logistics (3PL) company and is solely focused on eCommerce fulfillment (Fulfyld, 2021). A 3PL is an external company [to the customer with the product] that performs all or part of the company ’s logistic functions. A 3PL firm takes care of all supply chain processes, these proces ses include warehouse management, transportation, reporting, etc. (Suresh, Shah, & Baliga, 2017). Through the recent surge in online orders due to COVID-19 Fulfyld has increased its customer base and expanded rapidly. From the drastic increase in demand, F ulfyld is required to fill more orders from acquiring more customers. More customers [products] have resulted in more orders, and more orders have resulted in larger amounts of orders to be packaged. The focus of this study is to determine possible solutions to help improve the packaging station at Fulfyld. By improving the packaging station at Fulfyld it will allow for more efficient use of the packers time, lower labor cost per package, and will increase the profit margin per order, which in turn will escalate cash flow for the company. “Logistics is one of the largest industries in the United States, with millions of shipments nationwide taking place each year” (Cramer, et al. , 2020). Fulfyld is estimated to fill approximately five hundred thousand orders  this year. With that number in mind, it is reasonable to assume there is an ample amount of opportunity to improve the process for the packaging station at Fulfyld. “With the exponential rise of eCommerce giants such as Amazon and Alibaba, the logistics industry faces a daunting task; same-day deliveries of millions of goods with razor-thin margins” (Cramer, et al., 2020). The goal of this study is to improve the process of the packaging station in order to increase margins for Fulfyld. There are many competitors in this industry, and every dollar counts, especially when Fulfyld is a small, start- up company. The packaging station is one small part in a large operation, but it is a major part of the overall process and is important for the growth of the company. Allowing for the packagers to be more efficient will increase morale, productivity, and will allow for new employees to be trained faster so they can be productive in a timelier manner. The objective of this study is to conduct a DMAIC analysis of the company Fulfyld to see if there are ways to improve the logistics operations.

10,PROJECT MANAGEMENT: ENGINEERING VS. NON-ENGINEERING,@astate.edu,"Project management, Project manager, engineer, non-engineer, qualifications, salary","Anyone who may have  an interest in project management as a career choice will notice that there are two types of project managers: engineering and non- engineering. Project management is a career that is on the rise, and it is also showing up in many industries. After completing a job search in a high populated city, one can notice there are quite a few differences between the two types of project management positions. This project covers the following information: number of jobs looking for engineering vs non -engineering project managers, the salary difference between engineering vs non -engineering project managers, and the ski lls/qualifications that differ and are the same. After compiling the data, it is clear that “project manager” is a title that may be overused in other industries. Due to the different educational backgrounds needed between the two, the salary gap varies. A lso, the project management roles for non-engineers have more variance in salary and skills needed due to the industry and educational background needed. The purpose of this study is to examine the job market of project management with an engineering background compared to that of a non -engineering background. If all things are the same, than there should be no difference compared to finding jobs in project management no matter what background the person has. Keywords Project management, Project manager, engineer, non-engineer, qualifications, salary Introduction Project management positions are on the rise in multiple industries . There are project management positions in the engineering industry as well as non -engineering. This is due to the skills needed for a project manager. A successful project manager should be able to not only have great technical skills, they should also have leadership skills, business management skills, be able to lead a team, and be able to complete projects based on the objectives given. For the non-engineering industries, project management positions can be found in marketing, hospitality, education, and even more. This career growth, however, is not a new trend. From 2010- 2020, there was an estimated 15.7 million positions added worldwide (Tang et al., 2018).  The project management career is continu ously on the rise. It is estimated that there will need to be 87.7 million project managers by 2027 globally (Ichsan et al., 2021). These positions will range from entry-level to experienced level. There are concerns that the incoming generation  into the workforce might not have the proper project manageme nt skills, Generation Z , will be able and willing to fill the demand. Due to the increased demand for project management skills in many industries, universities had to start revising their curriculum for various programs  to reflect the skill sets needed for project management ( Vicente et al., 2019) . This was after research that noted that there is a gap between industry and academia. This revision in the curriculum should allow for more graduates to fulfill the positions need. On the engineering side , project managers are one of the top careers for engineer s as they enter the job market after they graduate. When engineers enter the job market, the first job they will receive is  not the typical engineer. Instead, engineers will find positions as project manag ers, lead system engineers, and technical sale s (Kotnour and Farr, 2005). This job shift is what started the evolution of the engineering management discipline. As technology quickly advances, the project management role has also improved. It is said, “Pro ject management will have a direct relationship to the quality of engineering project completion” (Liu, 2014). Therefore, project managers have an especially important role in engineering projects.  With important roles, there is more responsibilities. For example, project managers in the construction industry were shown to have high role stress that caused job burnout which either poorly affected their job performance or it caused them to leave the profession  altogether (Wu et al., 2019).

11,THE IMPORTANCE OF VALUE ANALYSIS (VA) EARLY IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT’S LIFE CYCLE,@astate.edu,"Value Analysis, Project management, Project Life Cycle,  Civil Infrastructure, Choosing by Advantages.","Implementation of Value Analysis (VA)  early in a project ’s life cycle, during the planning and schematic design phases, can  save a project as much as 30% to 40%  more as compared to later implementation during the design development and construction phases. VA is a process of arriving at an optimal solution to a complex issue , often an infrastructure improvement related issue, through a structured and reasoned analysis of factors and functions related to the issue.  The overarching goal is for all VA participants and project stakeholders to feel confident that the best solution was, in fact, achieved. On a conventional civil or architectural infrastructure project, the early conception of a project generally begins with a “slow start” as the project team is formed, the schedule is generated, the scope is refined, and the budget is negotiated. Following the slow start, the project q uickly gains momentum and much of the project’s scope is completed within a relatively short duration. This paper will focus on the importance of implementing VA processes and strategies early in the project life cycle, during the “slow start” phase, to effectively shorten the overall project life cycle. Early implementation will in turn increase client satisfaction, prevent  project rework, and thus optimize the project’s overall value and success. Keywords Value Analysis, Project management, Project Life Cycle,  Civil Infrastructure, Choosing by Advantages. Introduction More common now than ever, there is a desire and need to deliver projects more quickly and with greater efficiency . A Confucius quote says, “It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop” (SLOWW, 2020). While this philosophy may be considered valuable words of wisdom for one to live their personal life by, it is cringe-worthy to an experienced project manager on an infrastructure project seeking to deliver the project on schedule and on budget. Projects that drag on and are unnecessarily delayed cost time and money, often turning a profitable project into an unprofitable one. Projects, especially civil or architectural infrastructure projects, typically follow a lif e cycle characterized by a stretched “S” as shown in Exhibit 1. P resented in Exhibit 1 is  a graphical view of a stretched “ S” project life cycle with time on the x-axis and % project completion on the y- axis. The typical stretched “S” project lifecycle is a slow- fast-slow movement towards project delivery (Meredith et al, 2019). During the initial, or “ slow start”, phase the project is conceived and much of the critical groundwork is laid to kick off the project; the project team is formed ; the schedule is created ; key milestones are set ; project stakeholders are engaged; and predesign / preconstruction brainstorming is taking shape. During the middle phase, also known as the ‘quick momentum’ phase or the “project implementation” phase, the bulk of the work and production occurs. On a civil engineering or architectural infrastructure project, this middle phase consists of advancing design concepts to final drafts, conducting public outreach, and coordinating reviews by oversight agencies to o btain approval. In other words, the real project ‘work’ is happening during this middle phase. In the final “slow finish” phase the project is being terminated; the design is completed; the project is closed out, final review comments are addressed, and fi nal invoices are issued. It is during the  “slow start”  phase that Value Analysis (VA)  should be implemented  to maximize results. Understandably this initial phase of the project’s life cycle already seems slow enough, it is called the “slow start” phase after all, so why introduce another process such as VA? All too often owners, and government agencies leading the delivery of projects, skip the implementation of VA to expedite a project  by heading straight to designing and engineering. However, omission can be a serious and costly misstep that causes avoidable repercussions further into",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513
12,BUSINESS CYCLE ANALYSIS USING STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL: DATA AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES RELATED TO ANALYSING EUROPEAN ECONOMIES,@ttu.edu,"Business Cycle Analysis, Cumulative Sum Control Charts, Statistical Process Control, Self-Starting","The analysis of business cycles has been of interest to economists for more than a century. How ever, the focus of research has shifted over time -  from the ambition of understanding the entire economic process in the beginning to the binary identification of growth and recessionary turning points today. Over the last decades, various statistical models have been utilized for this purpose. Most recently, a new paradigm has been introduced: Modelling business cycles based on the Statistical Process Control (SPC) technique of Self -Starting Cumulative Sum (SS -CUSUM) control charts. In an initial case stu dy, it has been shown that this new approach can reliably reproduce the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research’s business cycle turning points. The approach further identifies periods of steady state performance with statistically differentiable means and/or standard deviations, as well as patterns of economic activity leading up and away from recessions. The research presented in this paper explores data and methodological related issues that arise when applying the SPC business cycle analysis approach to European economies. Over the course of this study, different sources for macroeconomic data and reference business cycle turning points are evaluated and the implications of the results for the SPC model discussed. This paper is considered the next step in establishing SPC as a paradigm for modelling and analysis of aggregate economic activity that allows engineering managers to better understand the environment, they conduct business in. Keywords Business Cycle Analysis, Cumulative Sum Control Charts, Statistical Process Control, Self-Starting Introduction Business cycles have been a phenomenon of interest to economic theorist worldwide for over a century.  In the U.S., it was Mitchell (1913, 1927) who notably gave an analytic description of the processes of business cycles. Later, Burns and Mitchell (1946) examined economic fluctuations in terms of distinct business cycle phases and thereby laid the foundation for the National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) approach to establish business cycle dates. Outside the U.S., economists as well started to study business cycles early in the twentieth century.  Examples being Aftalion and Lescure in France (Lescure, 1906; Aftalion, 1913), Cassel in Sweden (Cassel, 1924), and Lederer and Schumpeter in Germany (Schumpeter, 1911; Lederer, 1925). Burns and Mitchell (1946) defined a business cycle as: “ a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals whi ch merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic ” (p.3). Recognizing these phases and the transitions between them has been a concern to many macroeconomic researchers. Consequently, a great variet y of statistical approaches has  been introduced with the aim to identify business cycle turning points based on measures of economic activity. The NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determines the dates of  U.S. business cycles based on different measures of economic activity with focus on gross domestic product (GDP), as the single best measure of aggregate economic activity (NBER, 2022). Other indicators used to determine peak and trough dates are real personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll em ployment, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale -retail sales adjusted for price changes, employment as measured by the household survey, and industrial production. It is important to note that there is no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in the",ttu.edu,Texas Tech University,United States,33.59375255,

Engineering managers, empowered with this knowledge, face the Tragedy of the Commons or the economic and environmental problem of a publicly needed good, which if overused, is detrimental to another portion of society. The goal then is to maximize the greater good for the available resources at hand. When common goods share a system, overuse can result in overconsumption, under-investment, depletion, and even destruction. With shifting changes in climate and population, water is a common good, maximizing its opportunity value. This paper reviews Interstate Compacts, their operation to build compromise between two or more vested semi -sovereign stakeholders of a strategic resource and avoid the time and expense of “Equitable Apportionment” decisions through the Supreme Court of the United States. Equitable Apportionment, being a legal ruling, is thus rigid. The only way to enable change is to head back to court, while a Compact tends to be more flexible and leaves the court as a final resort. The review of previous and current water conflicts is undertaken, has shown no area i n the U.S has relative safety. The latest SCOTUS case concerning water occurs in a region with over 50 inches of rain annually. Therefore, engineers and technical managers responsible for water resources need to adjust their skillset and work hand in hand with policymakers to ensure the natural resources we use today are available for future endeavors and generations. Keywords Emerging Engineering Management, Transboundary Groundwater, Water Resource Management Introduction As the Once-ler states in Dr. Suess' the Lorax, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It is not."" The disregard for nature exemplified in this children's book is both emblematic and tells our current realities. The sentiment is an attempt to elucidate the critical nature of the tragedy of the commons going on with groundwater concerns and increased water supply disparity due to climate change and population growth. As water is a strategic and vital resource, raising awareness and knowledge for  Engineering Managers is crucial for limiting impact. Water is necessary for almost every form of production. Project management struggles could result in cost overruns and other unforeseen complications. We are now witnessing the first strictly groundwater case that the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has agreed to hear or “granting certiorari”. Upon completing the findings, if history repeats, it will be decided via equitable apportionment. It is invaluable to identify the differences between the two distinctive doctrines to share a transboundary water source. It is gaining an understanding of the possible avenues available to technical managers, recognizing each method's benefits and costs, and utilizing this knowledge to systemically identif y other groundwater sources that are threatened to dispute and litigate, thus beginning the conversation of an interstate compact to promote cooperation. Professor Robert Clark has referred to the equitable apportionment doctrine as the ""Federal interst ate common law applicable to interstate disputes over water rights in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court."" (Anderson et al., 1984)  This paper examines the outcomes of previous interstate disputes concerning water, a thorough review of all transboundary water conflicts that have required resolution via SCOTUS, and equitable apportionment (EA).

The U.S. defense manufacturing industry continues to face challenges in its dependence on foreign inputs, gaps in U.S.-based human capital, erosion of U.S. -based infrastructure, diminishing manufacturing sources and material providers, and global challenges to U.S. leadership in technological innovation . This study performs a syst em-level analysis of the U.S. defense industrial base’s supply chain to identify vulnerabilities and the associated impacts on economic and national security. A literature review and expert interviews help identify key factors and variables, and complex systems diagramming techniques elucidate the intricate relationships among the factors that result in supply chain vulnerabilities . This analysis provides further insights into the risk archetypes established by the whole -of- government assessment of the defe nse industrial base under Executive Order 13806 in July 2017 and analyzes the impacts of supply chain vulnerabilities on the traditional sectors of the defense manufacturing industry including aircraft, ground systems, missiles and munitions, nuclear warheads, radar and electronic warfare, shipbuilding, soldier systems, chemical and biological defense, and space systems. The study provides recommendations to inform ongoing efforts to fortify the U.S. defense industrial base. Risk mitigation strategies include strengthening the defense industrial base through direct investments, fortifying the manufacturing workforce with the appropriate technical and digital skills, modernizing defense acquisition processes, energizing the research and development enterprise, and partnering with the private sector and allied nations to promote innovation and resiliency. Keywords Supply chain vulnerabilities, defense industrial base, manufacturing workforce, foreign dependence, resiliency Introduction U.S. national security  and global influence relies on a U.S. defense industrial base that is “robust, resilient, secure, and innovative” (Department of Defense, 2021) . It must be cost -efficient, productive, and not unduly subsidized by taxpayer monies, while having sufficient surge capacities to respond to contingencies . The defense industrial base is a world -wide network that conducts research and development to design, produce, deliver, and maintain military weapons systems. It is multi-tiered, both public and private, and rel ies on a geographically and economically diverse ecosystem. The U.S. defense industrial base includes our leading defense industry companies, who remain global leaders in weapons innovation and production, while the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) remains the biggest buyer of goods for the U.S. government. As a whole, it is a large and complex system impacted by many macro forces. Over the past half century, there has been a steady decline in the manufacturing workforce and the innovation leadership that the U.S.  once enjoyed. Since the 1960s, the manufacturing sector  has shrunk from 40 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to 12 percent today (DoD, 2021). The shift in defense policy following the end of the Cold War left the traditional industrial base sectors with obsolete systems and processes ; meanwhile, the arrival of advanced digital technologies continues to drive a nd change the U.S. and global economies, creating heretofore unanticipated threats to the defense industrial base. In this environment, there has been an erosion of traditional supply markets, diminishing manufacturing sources and material suppliers, and w eakening of the U.S. -based industrial infrastructure with greater foreign dependency and greater risks to cybersecurity and product security (Peterson, 2021). The once dominant “military -industrial complex” that preserved American leadership in the world faces increasing risks and vulnerabilities that require modernization and a forward-looking defense industrial strategy (DoD Office of Industrial Policy, 2021).

Successful navigation of a dynamic landscape requires interdisciplinary viewpoints and an innate ability to comprehend broad socio-technical issues. More than any time in recent history, the technical business owner faces battlefield -like conditions due to the combinations of Industry 4.0, the Covid- 19 pandem ic, and the upheaval of socio -technical ecosystems. Wargaming allows management teams to explore complex what-if scenarios. This article lays out a methodology for developing and exercising simple wargames that will anticipate risks and opportunities facing business operations, rather than waiting until the unthinkable happens, too late to react. The wargaming method calls for four stages, 1) Design, 2) Preparation, 3) Execution and 4) Analysis. Each stage provides useful data for business development. The design stage requires the identification of key metrics. The preparation stage examines variation and uncertainty. The execution stage demands cross -discipline cooperation. The analysis phase challenges the logic of strategic plans. The article includes a sample wargame and the associated findings for a small business. Three key outcomes resulted from the sample wargame. The m anagement team discovered: 1) cross disciplines were not operating in concert, 2) useful data was easily available but was not being used to assess customer satisfaction, and 3) certain combinations of supply shortages, elevated weather conditions, and wor kforce turnover could prove terminal if the business is unprepared. As a result of the wargame, the management team reconsidered their strategic plans. Keywords Wargaming, strategy, disruption, collaboration, planning, Industry 4.0, gamification, multi -discipline Introduction: How Can Businesses Prepare for an Uncertain Future? Engineering managers need t o lead their organizations through social, technical, and political ecosystems  that are being disrupted by massive changes.  In particular, the technology ecosystem is evolving at an exponential rate (Pistrui et al. 2018).  To successfully guide an organization through dynamic  and chaotic times, the manager needs to foster interdisciplinary cooperation while growing the organization’s awareness of  broad socio-technical issues.  The day- to-day details and nuances of the existing business  must be managed to maintain stability while simultaneously morphing the business. The way forward for the corporation could take many twists and turns, and the choice of the best direction can be obscured by interwoven variables.  In many organizations, there will be significant resistance to change as the typical prevailing approach is to run with a business -as-usual mindset by slowly introducing incremental changes. Unfortunately, technical disruptions are com ing so fast and are having such profound impacts on society , that the business-as-usual approach has become a recipe for failure!  Authors Tuff and Goldbach address this problem in their book, Detonate (2018): “In light of what most of you are experiencing, pressure against long-standing business models and ways of working as a result of advances in technology, no amount of incremental improvement is going to create the necessary changes.”  Tuff and Goldbach",udmercy.edu,University of Detroit Mercy,United States,42.41403185,-83.13786010722785

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is utilized in this study to optimize Business Process (BP) through Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to understand the effects of industry 4.0 smart processes on our current processes. To this end, this study conducted validation of process eligibility of RPA implementation, evaluation of potential, importance, and classification of processes is done to analy ze current processes prior to applying RPA through simulation and modelling. The results indicate that the weights of the parameters such as transaction volume, FTE savings, time taken per run, and sub -activities had high percentiles in the proposed model in comparison to the current model.

Introduction Currently, the business processes and activities in the manufacturing industry are having limitations in terms of lacking seamless integration, value -driven processes, business intelligence,  and dynamic optimization  (Bhaskar, 2018). Industry 4.0 (4IR) requ ires self-optimization, autonomous operation, and smart systems to bridge the gap between traditional business process requirements and industry 4.0 smart processes  (Skilton and Hovsepian, 2017) . Business process reengineering (BPR) is an instrument that can be utilized to change business processes and reshape the entire business process (Bhaskar, 2018). Processes are a combination of business activities that results in the desired output. Whenever processes turn out to be inefficient and outdated to an extent that they cannot provide intended results they must be re -engineered. According to (Habib and Shah, 2013) the organizations that do not transform according to changes in the environment will be kicked out from the markets. Industry 4.0 has seen as a radical and groundbreaking transformation categorized by the omnipresence of machine learning and artificial intelligence, mobile Internet, and smaller, unique sensors  (Hanin & Mohammed, 2020) . According to (Habib and Shah, 2013), “the 4IR concept also known as the industry 4.0 model, is a revolution triggered from the application and use of the Internet of Things (I oT), and cyber -physical systems (CPSs) ”. Industry 4.0 comprises the following: physical cyber systems, smart factories, spontaneous order, new process systems in procurement together with distribution, development of novel services and products, customized human necessities, and corporate social responsibility (Skilton and Hovsepian, 2017) . Therefore, 4IR involves the s uper connection between the market and technology in all industries enabled by IT.

A business strategy describes the combination of actions performed and decisions taken by an organi zation to achieve planned business goals together with a secure competitive advantage in the market ( Kitsios and Kamariotou, 2021) . Digitalization is a best practice sustainable business strategy (Kitsios and Kamariotou, 2021). Digital transformation is the use of innovative, swift, and frequently changing digital technology to address challenges such as transforming processes, ex periences, and cultures that are manual or non- digital to digital ( Perkin and Abraham, 2021).  Examples of digital transformations include cloud computing, AI-powered chatbots, and master data. etc. Small and mid -size enterprises  (SMEs) are  confronted by diverse challenges in the implementation of digital transformations. The smart use of industry 4.0 tools has a major impact in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and performance in businesses (Javaid, et. al., 2020). SMEs are expected to reconfigure processes in line with these advancements. Based on these arguments, SMEs in the context of digitalization facilitate more research to improve resilience and sustainability measures.

Furthermore,  the motivation to attain these skills, driven by the efficiency created through div ision of labor, and the resulting financial benefits, clearly drives certain individuals with capability, aptitude, and agency to invest in their own personal skills.  This investment not only benefits them but  is applied to the challenges facing humanity in the location where they ply their trade for the betterment of society at large (Goldin, 2016). The immense challenges facing a society often need a synthesis of diverse skills working in tandem to accomplish comprehensive objectives.  As a result, a variety of organizational structures form in society to harness these individual skills and apply them to societal goals.  The diversity of these organizations in structure is immense , taking many forms (religious, civic, trade unions, commercial, governmental) and divergent structures (for profit, not for profit, volunteer) mirroring the complexity of the diverse societal challenges and needs facing humanity. The seamless nature of uptake of individual skills  applied to organizational objectives though is fra ught with difficulties.   Often the population where the organization operates may not have the general skills needed to fulfill organizational goals.  Potentially  the people already in the company do not have the skills needed for the new objectives facing the company due to knowledge obsolescence, skill atrophy, or market shifts in needed skills . Additionally, even if an individual has the general knowledge, there is typically a significant amount of nonfungible learning which happens in organizations where an individual learns how to apply their specific knowledge, in a productive method, within the framework of the target organization, resulting in effective goal achievement. Organizations address these issues through targeted investments.   Talent acquisition activities look to attract the best individuals with skills, talents, and cultural values closely aligned with organizational needs.  For these new hires, onboarding activities, mentoring, training, and targeted job assignments are setup to accelerate their productivity upon starting.  For employees already at the organization, a variety of training, development plans, coaching, job design,",gmail.com,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

A CASE FOR COLOMBIA,@unal.edu.co,"Power Market, Competitive market, Cournot, Stackelberg, Option Games, Uncertainty.","Most utilities we re integrated monopolies at the beginning of the electricity industry, either investor (mainly in the United States) or publicly owned.  However, since the 1980s, many power markets have shifted from traditional to competitive environments. Profit maximization is more important than cost reduction in the new economic models. However, competitive electrical markets do not exist in practice b ecause there is concentration in a reduced number of firms. In other words, power markets are organized as oligopolies, and the action of one of the agents can dramatically influence market variables. Given the above, it proposes a basic two states game in  a dupolist market integrating real options and a game theory framework to analyze strategic investment in the power markets and the effects of endogenous competition. First, it calculates the real value option for each firm, assuming that these are price- acceptance (Cournot competence) with a lineal inverse demand function in relation quantity. Then, this paper develops the competitive game characteristics for  the cost function of each firm.

Keywords Power Market, Competitive market, Cournot, Stackelberg, Option Games, Uncertainty. Introduction At the beginning of the electricity industry, most utilities were integrated monopolies. Since the 1980s several power markets was restructured to competitive environments (Shivaie & Ameli, 2015). In the new economic models, it is more important to profit maximization than cost minimization. However, real competitive power markets do not exist in practice because by nature there is a tendency to have a concentration in a reduced number of firms (Zhang et al., 2009), in other words, it is organized as an oligopoly market (Lopez et al., 2017). Papers such as (Fosso et al., 1999; Phupha et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Rouhani et al., 2013; Gil et al., 2014; Maceira et al., 2015; Alizadeh & Jadid, 2015; Fitiwi et al., 2015) aiming to develop methodologies that can be utilized for making generato rs' expansion decisions.

21,INVENTORY MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION FOR CAPITAL GOODS MAINTENANCE,@ufpr.br,"Industry 4.0, Big Data, Spare Parts, Inventory Management, Maintenance, Supply Chain.","Spare parts play an important role in supporting capital goods maintenance, contributing to downtime reduction and lifetime extension. However, once systems are becoming more and more advanced, and their reliability has also increased, both trends enlarged  the amount of components with low demand, and spare parts management are becoming more complicated. Consequently, given the mindset change about delivery times with Covid-19 pandemic and the concern related to global spending in aftersales services , together with customers demanding high uptime levels and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) reduction, the search for more efficient methods to manage spare parts inventory has emerged. Based on the use of industry 4.0 techniques , the aim of this study is to propose  a framework for spare parts provisioning, reducing both maintenance and downtime costs. Keywords Industry 4.0, Big Data, Spare Parts, Inventory Management, Maintenance, Supply Chain. Introduction Extremely vital to downtime reduction is parts availability, which means having available parts waiting for the customer demand. Inventory control policy, particularly for items with low and uncertain demand, has a significant role in parts availability (Boone, Hazen & Skipper, 2018). The authors mention that the perfect set-up is having parts available when required only, with short lead times and, as an effect, providing customer service without increasing operational costs. However, an increase in availability typically requires an increase in inventory on -hand and, consequently, also increasing the overall logistics cost. The costs can be drastically affected also when, due to a back order occurrence, it’s required an expedited freight to satisfy custome r demands. This critical relationship between availability and premium freight cost indicates that the primary goal is to seek  for a balance between both KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The main challenge is to correlate the cost of having the part available with the cost associated with a back order. What matters for capital goods users are the costs during their entire life cycle, known as the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Important to mention that d owntime cost involves not only direct costs, connect ed to the output reduction of the capital good, but also indirect costs, that cause loss of reputation and result, unfortunately, in future sales decrease (Bake, Pessôa & Becker, 2018). Extensive research has been conducted in this area, that include studies related to machine availability (Ghodrati, Ahmadi & Galar 2013), preventive maintenance (Jiang, Chen & Zhou, 2015), and repair level (Chang, Liao & Hsiao 2015) across industry segment s, such as OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) or a third -party provider (Behfard, van der Heijden & Al Hanbali, 2015). And recently, new studies have emerged emphasizing the importance of quickly reacting to changes, a perspective established with the Covid-19 pandemic (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2021). Connecting these and other sub -areas, and considering the importance of more efficient methods to manage spare parts inventory, the aim of this study is, based on the use of industry 4.0 techniques, propose a fra mework for spare parts provisioning, reducing both maintenance and downtime costs, and providing a perspective closer to the expected post-pandemic.",ufpr.br,Universidade Federal do Paraná,Brazil,-23.59844395,-51.673359178875074
22,APPLICATION OF SYSTEM MODELING LANGUAGE (SysML) IN CYBER LEVEL ARCHITECTURE OF INDUSTRY 4.0,@astate.edu,Industry 4.0; Systems Engineering Modelling L anguage (SysML); Cyber Level; Model -Based Systems Engineering,"Although the emergence of Industry 4.0 introduces a revolution in the field of manufacturing, it imposes security threats on the seamless operation of the network system at the same time. The c yber level is one of the pivotal architectures of industry 4.0 that controls the entire Industry 4.0 network via the cyber -physical systems. As Industry 4.0 is still in the developing phase, to successfully adopt the concept of Industry 4.0, organizations' technical managers and practitioners need to broadly understand the architecture and functionality of the cyber level. Although several conceptual ideas and theoretical frameworks are prevalent in the existing li terature, there is a lack of research that focuses on the structural and behavioral architecture of the cyber level of industry 4.0 through the lens of a systemic approach. To address this gap, in this study, we apply systems modeling language (SysML) to capture the complex architecture of the cyber level of industry 4.0 via a set of system modeling diagrams. The proposed approach will help the practitioners to understand the detailed structural and behavioral aspects of the cyber level of industry 4.0 in order to construct an efficient cyber security framework. Keywords Industry 4.0; Systems Engineering Modelling L anguage (SysML); Cyber Level; Model -Based Systems Engineering (MBSE); Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Introduction The first industrial revolution started in the 18th century which was grounded by mechanization after the invention of the steam engine. In the 19th   century, the second industrial revolution took place with the introduction of electricity in mass production. In the next century, the third revolution introduced automation in the manufacturing system due to the invention of the microcomputer (Arvind & Bourne, 2016) . In the 21st century, industry 4.0 has brought in cutting-edge technology with an extreme impact on the field of manufacturing processes. In I ndustry 4.0 , the adaptation of the internet of things (IoT)  against the backdrop of cyber-physical systems (CPS) increases flexibility and decreases the complexity of the manufacturing process. Industry 4.0 supports a more adjustable manufacturing system to meet the different customized requirement s of the customer in today 's competitive business environment (Vaidya et al., 2018). Cyber-physical systems are the paradigm of industry 4.0 which efficiently integrates the physical system with cyberspace, where actions like computation, communication , and control are executed.  CPS is one of the core technologies of Industry 4.0.  CPS structure consists  of 5 levels which are represented by 5c for the manufacturing process. The 5 levels are connection, conversion, cyber, cognition, and configuration. Advanced sensors, data analysis systems, computer networks, and cloud computing technologies are the core of CPS (Bagheri et al., 2015) . Various sensors and computer networks used in the operations of industry 4.0 generate a huge amount of data (Lee et al., 2015). Cloud systems help the CPS to interchange the data instantaneously. On the other hand, sensor deployment help CPS identify the disturbance of the system and automatically takes the necessary step to compensate for the perturbations.

23,IMPROVING RELIABILITY INDICES OF POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM LEVERAGING MANAGEMENT ORIENTED APPROACH,@astate.edu,System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI); System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI); Failure,"Power Systems have recently been receiving a lot of attention for their vulnerable condition and aging nature. When a component in this system approaches its maximum age, the frequency of fault occurrence increases. Consequently, if a component fails in any power substation, the system still takes an extend ed period of time to return to normal which affects uninterrupted power distribution. Customer satisfaction in a power distribution system can be measured through two distinct reliability indexes called “System Average Interruption Duration Index” (SAIDI) and “System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI)” which measure power interruption duration and frequency. Every year Distribution Utilities are given a particular target to achieve a certain SAIDI and SAIFI. However, distribution utilities continu ously fail to achieve those targets due to mismanagement of maintenance operations during an interruption. This paper will go deeper into finding the causes behind those problems and recommending effective ways to reduce them. To pursue the objective of th is paper, a quality management-based six sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analysis, Improvement, Control) approach is used to identify the root causes of that mismanagement and suggest a proper solution strategy, followed by reliability analysis. Consequently , this paper proposes a novel fault management system during the improvement phase of DMAIC. Subsequent risk analysis has been done to show that DMAIC has successfully been able to address the problem and the risk of prolonged interruption delay has been reduced to a significant margin. Keywords System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI); System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI); Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA); Reliability, DMAIC, Management. Introduction The condition of vulnerable power distribution systems has been the subject of a number of studies from different points of view recently. Few researchers have explored the nexus between quality management based approaches as a pathway to improve power system dynamics as some quality control ideas can be applied to in the power distribution system to make it more effective. As one of such quality management -based approaches, DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analysis, Improvement, Control) model, which is the roadmap for Six Sigma, ha s been adopted in this study to improve the reliability indices power distribution system like “System Average Interruption Duration Index” (SAIDI) and “System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI)”. Balaji et al. (2018) used a similar DMAIC approach but their goal was to determine how this process contribute to increase of revenue in power distribution utilities. To improve the quality of the service, champion, master black belt, black belt and green belt personnel are identified among the existing setup. It was found out that DMAIC methodology can significantly contribute to improvement of overall revenue of the utility. However, proper distribution of responsibilities among personnel and slight readjustment of power distribution planning are needed. Specifically, this study has been presented against the background of management-oriented methodology to demonstrate its applicability and efficacy in dealing with power distribution system issues. Sony (2019) presented the application of lean six sigm a-based approach for power generation, transmission and distribution companies. Case studies done by this paper indicates that application of lean six sigma is economically beneficial, improves customer satisfaction. In the way, this paper also emphasizes that group activity is very important for success ul lean six sigma projects.

24,WORKFORCE DISENGAGEMENT - THE EASIEST MANAGEMENT METHOD,@wsu.edu,"Workforce Engagement, Engineering Management.","Engagement is defined as the state of being passionately committed to a cause. Author Lonnie Wilson has applied this definition of engagement at work and thus coined the phrase “workforce engagement”. Managers have five high leverage points for sustaining workforce engagement: kaizen, transparency, walking the talk, good supervision, and trust. Also, while hygiene factors such as pay and benefits are not intrinsically motivational, their absence is demotivational.  Since most workers come to work with intrinsic motivation, it is important not to demotivate employees with micromanagement and unnecessary competition.  However, being an excellent manager that  can sustain engagement is difficult and requires discipline and selflessness. Thus, it is much easier and more natural for a manager to disengage his or her workforce. Workforce disengagement is the easiest management method which consists of managers taking care of themselves and blaming others for everything else. This paper presents the methods managers can take to prevent disengaging their workforce. Keywords Workforce Engagement, Engineering Management. Introduction Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma and Bakker (2002) defined engagement as a positive, fulfilling, work- related state of mind which is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption.  Vigor is characterized by elevated levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties.  Dedication is characterized by a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.  Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and deeply engrossed in one’s work. Thus, engagement is the state of being passionately committed to a cause. Author Lonnie Wilson has applied this definition of engagement at work and coined the phrase “workforce engagement”.  Being an engineering mana ger includes the most basic task of management which is supervision.  Supervision ideally means “to do all that is necessary to make your subordinates as successful as possible” (Wilson, 2019).  Supervisors must take the responsibility for the skills and outcomes of their workers.  However, this requires that the supervisor knows what to do, knows how to do it, and has the resources to do it. Being an excellent manager that can sustain engagement is difficult and requires discipline and selflessness. Thus, it is much easier and more natural for a manager to disengage his or her workforce. Workforce disengagement is the easiest management method which consists of managers taking care of themselves and blaming others for everything else. This theoretical paper presents how to avoid disengaging workers by not doing what comes naturally. Engagement and Disengagement Loops Engaged employees are physically committed (hard working), intellectually committed (problem solving), and emotionally committed (care about the work and colleagues) (Kahn, 1990).  The engagement loop in Exhibit 1 shows three types of employees: “Loyalists” who are engaged employees, “Lurkers” who are not engaged, and “Laggards” who are actively disengaged (Wilson, 2019).  Loyalists are suffi ciently satisfied with their work or “satisficed”.  In the engagement loop, positive word spreads from the Loyalists to Lurkers who themselves begin to become engaged. In the engagement loop, the intensity of positivity increases.  However, the disengagement loop is the default position when management follows the status quo, and negative word spreads which converts neutral Lurkers into actively disengaged Laggards.  In the disengagement loop, the intensity of negativity increases.  Managers interested in the easiest management method and maintaining the status quo just fuel the disengagement loop.",wsu.edu,Washington State University,United States,46.7337716,-117.14980348311619
25,FEEDBACK RESEARCH PROCESS: FINDING YOUR RESEARCH FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY,@knights.ucf.edu,,"Literature research can be a tedious, laborious, and painstaking task to find the desired articles that meet the specification and topics for research. Standard research takes a path of searching for articles, reading abstracts, filtering, reading articles, and determining the article’s relevance. One might use the references of articles to find additional articles with core articles. Again, this path is laborious and painstaking. What if articles of interest could be found significantly faster? What if authors of interest could be found significantly faster? The feedback research process uncovers articles of interest, authors of interest, and journals of interest through a process that rapidly exposes this information. This paper intends to answer these questions by articulating a feedback research process. The feedback research process describes the steps and tools used to build the feedback research process. For the Engineering Management Researcher, this process can lead to finding the correct research papers faster, more effectively, and with more thorough coverage. Introduction When conducting a systematic literature review, one may begin the research using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). An example of the basic PRISMA research process i s shown in Exhibit 1 – PRISMA Research Flow. The PRISMA process is used in many systematic literature reviews and is required in many healthcare journals (Liberati et al., 2009). While not required in most research fields, this approach, research process, and methodology provide a mechanism for in -depth research. The PRISMA approach requires extensive documentation of search results and rigid documentation  but does not require analytical processing to complete. It is a painstaking and tedi ous process that may not be wholly appropriate for the broad subject of all research. However, it provides a significant starting point and base set of broad referenced work. Exhibit 1 – PRISMA Research Flow If someone starts research from scratch, they are likely new to doing research  or conducting research in a new field of study. If one is an expert in their field, they likely have a database of information at their disposal. Experienced researchers gain an affinity toward journals they value , authors they have cited  in the past , and people they have developed relationships with during their time conducting research. Starting from nothing  with literature research can be daunting, tedious, laborious, and painstaking to find the desired articles that meet the specifications and research topics.

Technical measures play a critical role in design  and management, where the set of technical measures is relied upon as an indicator of the project state for decision making, risk assessment, evaluation, and forecasting. Given the criticality of technical measures, it is important to know how to choose the “right” measures. This research answers the question: what guidance is published on how to select technical measures for the design of large -scale complex engineered systems in academic literature? A systematic review is performed , identifying relevant sources through a formalized process that includes all sources that satisfy predetermined inclusion criteria, rather than including sources that support a desired finding, resulting in evidence-based data to understand the current guidance for technical measures selection. One hundred ninety- eight guidance statements for selection for technical measures for the design of large- scale complex engineered systems are identified from the systematic review  and analyzed via content analysis.  It is identified that the current guidance for the selection of technical measures is high level, most often focusing on qualities that the measures should exhibit and identifying from where the measures are derived. Specific, practical guidance is lacking, leaving the selection of a critical piece of systems design largely up to the best judgment and experience of the systems engineer. The contribution of this research is an overview of published guidance for the selection of technical measures and identification of gaps in guidance that future research can address. Keywords technical measurement, systems engineering, systematic review, measurement Introduction Technical measures provide the basis for insight, assessment, risk management, test, evaluation, and decision making in the design of complex engineered systems. Technical metrics could be considered a hidden foundation of systems engineering and engineering management as technical measu res serve as a basis for informing decisions about the system and the project . Technical measures inform decision makers (engineering managers and systems en gineers) about the status of a system during the project. As technical measures are promoted as the basis for sound decisions, it is worth considering how to eva luate if a set of measures directs decisions as intended. In other words: how do we know what makes a “good” set of technical measures?   Further, what impacts can a “bad” set of technical measures have? Improving the understanding of the selection and impa cts of technical measures may allow practitioners (engineering managers and systems engineers)  to better select measures, potentially resulting in better designs or reducing wasted effort on tracking poor measures. The first step to understanding the impac t of the selection is to investigate selection practice.

In particular, Lean Production and Lean Six Sigma (LP/LSS) are improvement methodologies that have been utilized for continuous improvement in manufacturing and service contexts. However, the diffusion of LP/LSS applications is still evolving in public sector organizations, and more specifically in Local Government Organizations (LGOs). The development and implementation of LP/LSS in LGO settings encounters many challenges (referred to as critical success factors in this work) which may limit the achievement of performance outcomes. This research area is also limited in terms of developing frameworks (or models) that examine the impact of factors on system outcomes. Thus, the purpose of this work is to investigate research design methods (i.e., data collection and data analysis methods), quantitative studies, and then develop a conceptual framework that conceptually hypothesizes the relationship between a set of potential significant factors on technical and social system outcomes. This work could be a starting point for scholars and practitioners to further develop and test other models with other potential outcomes to advance the maturity of this research area for best practices. This development of a framework also helps support the literature to understand the influence of factors on system outcomes for LP/LSS success. Keywords Lean production, lean six sigma, framework, success factors, systematic literature review, local government , public organizations Introduction Quality improvement methodologies, such as Lean Production and Lean Six Sigma (LP/LSS), have been widely used to address many challenges related to quality (Wartati et al., 2021) . LP/LSS has been developed and implemented in various organizational settings , including manufacturing and service- based organizational environments (Antony et al., 2019; Vamsi Krishna Jasti & Sharma, 2014) . Further, LP/LSS are best known for engineering processes and identifying the root causes of issues  related to non -value-added activities for better performance outcomes, for instance, lead time, efficiency, cost, and customer value  (Improta et al., 2019; Melton, 2005) . While LP/LSS is predominant improvement methodology in manufacturing research literature (Wartati et al., 2021), this improvement methodology also has been observed in public sector organizations, especially in local government organizations (LGOs). The development and implementation of LP/LSS are often associated with difficulties and challenges (referred to in this work as critical success factors “CSFs”) that may hinder achieving full potential benefits. Scholars have widely addressed these CSFs in different organizational settings and developed quantitative models to study the effect of these factors on outcome success  (Chiarini & Brunetti, 2019; Gonzalez Aleu, 2016; Noori, 2015) . However, the evolution and development of LP/LSS in LGOs is still at an early stage of maturity with a lack of quantitative models (or conceptual models) to study LP/LSS success  with a rigorous and comprehensive set of factors .  Thus, this work aims to address this gap by proposing a preliminary conceptual framework that subjectively hypothesizes the impact of the CSFs on system outcomes. The C SFs used in this work were identified based on a previous effort (Author, 2022). To achieve the goal of this work, a systematic literature r eview (SLR) was used to analyze empirical publications in this research area. The SLR is a concrete review process used to analyze scientific studies on a research area (or field) in a systematic manner (Tranfield et al., 2003) . Prior to developing the preliminary conceptual framework, this work analyzed the research design methods and discussed quantitative models developed in this area. Thus, this work aims to address the following research questions: R.Q.1 What are the commonly-used research methods for data collection and data analysis? R.Q.2 What are the quantitative models developed within this research area (LP/LSS in LGOs)?",vt.edu,Virginia Tech,United States,37.22192675,-80.42728184013652

Organizations are seeking cost- cutting and profit-maximizing strategies, and cloud computing appears to be one of them . The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence cloud computing adoption and provide key reliability indicators. The study used snowball sampling, a survey research method and a questionnaire as part of the research design. Finally, the research was conducted within South Africa. According to the study's findings, security and privacy concerns are the main factors influencing cloud service acceptance negatively. Furthermore, the study indicates that scalability, availability, and relative advantage are motivating factors for cloud computing adoption. Finally, the study identifies three essential key reliability indicators: reliability, service availability, and performance predicta bility. Keywords Adoption, Barriers, Cloud computing, Motivators, Reliability, Technology Introduction Cloud computing is an old idea that has brought forth economic advantages to businesses (Ibrahimov et al., 2019) . This old idea has been modernized in a way that brings strategies to enable business agility needs (Le e t al., 2018) . Lately, organizations are swiftly migrating to cloud computing because of its advantages and benefits; especially the advantage of cost -saving and computational agility which both cannot be ignored (Jianwen & Wakil, 2019) . Liu (2016), suggested that cloud computing can successfully advance the agility of an organization. Cloud computing has become a notable option for most organizations in South Africa and around the world which allow them to focus more on the essence of business mission in lieu of information technology (IT) related issues (Yuvaraj, 2015) . Kumar and Vidhyalakshmi (2018), state that cloud computing resolves many issues encountered in traditional IT such as disaster recovery, but it presents u ncertainty about reliability to most organization s. According to Kumar (2017, p. 816), Vithayathil (2018, p. 121) cloud computing is defined as: “A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on- demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computi ng resources (for example , networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”. This is found as the standard definition of cloud computing adopted by NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology in 2011). There are three well-known cloud service providers (CSP) which are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Microsoft cloud operating system is known as Azure. Azure provides clients with three basic cloud services models IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS ( Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service)  depending on the need of the client (Liu, 2016) . Exhibit 1 shows the three service models of cloud computing and briefly explained each model. The Amazon cloud platform which is known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been around since 2004 and it has been providing its cloud services consistently. As a result, AWS is the largest CSP with a 47% market share (Wu & Gereffi, 2019) . AWS offers global computing, databases, storage, and other many services which can be accessed via the internet from any device and anywhere in the world (Wu & Gereffi, 2019).

30,DEEP LEARNING MODELS AND TOOLS FOR DISASTER EVACUATION AND ROUTING,@uidaho.edu,Emergency communication applications; machine learning; geographic information shapefiles; earthquake,"Engineering managers and transportations planners need robust tools to com municate evacuation routing plans following disruptions from natural hazards. This research considers the New Madrid Seismic Zone, uses machine learning algorithms to determine best routes, and disseminates these routes via a phone application to manage evacuation capacity on surface roadways. Effective communication of impacted routes and safest options are a vital part of these planning efforts. The phone application developed here interfaces with state department of transportation travel maps to notify the user of an earthquake in progress or aftershocks. After the initial notification, the application will display a detailed warning message and indicate the quickest and safest route options to nearby shelters. Once a route is selected, the user will be p resented with guided directions. The route selection will be determined from machine learning algorithms developed in this research group that are integrated with geographic information shapefiles. The notifications will display impaired or unusable roadwa ys, nearest shelter, and best options for safe egress from the seismic zone. The results of this study can be used to improve safety following a major earthquake through the creation and use of a real-time communications application. Keywords Emergency communication applications; machine learning; geographic information shapefiles; earthquake Introduction This research extends previous research in disaster restoration and flood prediction (Ramachandran, et al, 2015a; Ramachandran, et al, 2015b; Ramachan dran, et al, 2016; Corns, et al, 2016; Ojha et al, 2018; Gude, et al, 2020)  to address a gap in communications tools and protocols . This proposed research uses deep learning and other computational intelligence techniques to predict road conditions at identified locations. The results of these algorithms are used as inputs to determine safe and effective routing schemas and communications processes surrounding natural hazard events. Machine/deep learning and data mining algorithms provide an opportunity to significantly improve the performance of automated tasks in seismology because they allow for more complex inference approaches that mimic the behavior of the human mind ( Ross et al., 2018). A deep learning neural network will be implemented with state - driven evolutionary algorithms on selected test sites to predict potential earthquake damage using geospatial features along with roadway capacity and general demographic data. It can be noted that by using deep learning, the elimination of being biased to events that were previously qui et regions or for very large -magnitude events, without sacrificing detection sensitivity can be achieved (Ross et al., 2018). This research focuses on the use of proper evacuation plans in response to a disaster to end users through an application. Following an earthquake, road conditions for individuals to reach necessary facilities and for emergency personnel to travel throughout the region may not be known and cause delays. The delays could entail a delay in life saving activities for people injured in an earthquake. Restoring water, electricity, telecommunication facilities, as well as maintaining operations at health facilities, are top priority in a post-earthquake situation where accurate and up-to- date informa tion about various road conditions/outages are crucial.

31,ISOMORPHOLOGICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND WATER SUPPLY PORTFOLIOS,@ttu.edu,"Water resources management, portfolio optimization, volatility, isomorphology","Portfolio optimization is emerging as a  useful methodology in water resource planni ng for managing water supply portfolios; especially with respect to future challenges posed by system stressors such as climate change and population growth.  Specifically, it has been suggested that surface water sources closely resemble stocks whereas groundwater sources can best be thought of as low risk assets such as government bonds.  The usefulness of portfolio optimization in this context is largely determined by the strength of the parallels between financial and water resource engineering.  This paper begins with an exploration of Bertalanffy’s concept of isomorphology and how it can be leveraged to determine when the parallels between financial portfolio management and water resources management are substantive (homological or explanatory) and when they are only superficial (analogical).  Finally, the authors revisit and expand upon the substantive connections between financial and water resources portfolio s in aid of an isomorphically informed approach to the use of portfolio optimization in the l atter.  Portfolio optimization can be a useful methodology in the context of strategic water resource planning but only when the connections between financial asset management and water portfolio management are either homological or explanatory in nature. Keywords Water resources management, portfolio optimization, volatility, isomorphology Introduction A defining feature of Commons resources, such as water, is their finitude; whether in terms of total quantity available or replenishment/recharge rate.  Thus, a perennial problem in water resources management (WRM) is how to best balance competing goods in light of this finiteness.  The challenge is particularly pronounced in water systems located in arid/semi-arid environments where water  is hydrologically more scarce than other areas .  It is unsurprising, then, that optimization methodologies have enjoyed a surge of popularity in strategic water resource planning (defined here as looking 10+ years into the future). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in portfolio optimization techniques in particular.  Following Markowitz (1952), Tobin (1958), Lintner  (1965), and others, researchers have drawn parallels between financial portfolios composed of multiple, distinct types of assets (e.g., stocks and bonds) and water resource portfolios composed of more than water source (e.g., surface water from multiple sources, groundwater).  Markowitz (1952) argued that investors are not (and s hould not be) concerned solely with the expected return on a given asset.  They also, rightly, pay attention to the risk associated with the asset which is proxied by its volatility.  One of Markowitz’s key insights was that investors should also pay attention to the relationship between assets in a portfolio.  More specifically, the covariance between the assets.  Assets with a high positive covariance are comparably vulnerable whereas assets with negative covariance offset each other.  The goal, thus, is to construct a portfolio that demonstrates, minimally, neutral levels of covariance but, more ideally, some negative covariance so that losses for a given type of asset (e.g., stocks) can be offset by gains in another (e.g., bonds).  An optimized portfolio is one that maximizes reward for a given level of risk or, conversely, minimizes risk for a given reward level.  While classical modern portfolio theory has fallen out of favor in some financial circles, it has demonstrable appeal in water resources management (Fabozzi et al., 2007; Zenios, 2007). An early conceptual application of portfolio optimization in WRM is outlined by Beuhler (2006) .  He observes that water resource planning is typically dominated by cost considerations alone where, in his framework, cost (per unit volume of water) is the proxy for the return on an asset (Beuhler, 2006).  Given this emphasis, the traditional approach is to, not surprisingly, minimize cost.  Beuhler notes, however, that the risk associated with a given water",ttu.edu,Texas Tech University,United States,33.59375255,-101.89959552302756
32,DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT TO STUDY CONSUMER PREFERENCES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROCUREMENT OPTIONS,@mst.edu,"Renewable energy, discrete choice experiment, conditional logit model, utility, willingness to pay .","As the cost of renewables has decreased, options for energy procurement have proliferated to meet consumer demand. In addition to installing distributed  energy resources such as rooftop solar, consumers can subscribe to centralized green energy pricing programs through their utility or competitive electricity supplier. However, it is unclear how these options to procure renewable energy from the grid influence household-level decisions to install solar and vice versa. This study uses a discrete choice experiment to measure the influence of attributes including electricity source, cost, benefits, procurement effort, and carbon reduction, on household-level renewable energy procurement decisions. Three hundred participants were recruited through an online panel to participate in the experiment. The analysis suggests that consumers are most sensitive to costs, procurement effort, and benefits. Lower prices, hi gher incentives and lower effort options are preferred over default options. Consumers also expressed a higher willingness to pay for electricity sources with higher renewable content and benefits. This study can help engineering managers create low- carbon electricity procurement options which are preferred by residential consumers and increase the overall renewable content in the grid. Keywords Renewable energy, discrete choice experiment, conditional logit model, utility, willingness to pay . Introduction As the share of renewable energy in the grid is increasing, low -carbon electricity products have become increasingly accessible at the household level. Since 2010, renewable energy generation costs have fallen dramatically with wind energy costing 70% less and solar photovoltaics (PV) becoming 89% cheaper on average (Forbes, 2020) . With a steep fall in prices of solar PV and state regulations incentivizing centralized renewable generation, the options for residential consumers to cut emissions have multiplied. Solar PV installation may require initial costs for acquiring panels, renovating residential structures for efficiency, and labor (Rai & Beck, 2015). Solar PV provides the freedom to generate and consume renewable electricity while also allowing consumers to send additional power to the utility grid (distributed generation). Despite the initial costs and effort, solar panels have seen an increase in demand as they help consumers cut their electricity procurement costs, decrease dependency on utility companies and reduce carbon footprint. Almost 6% of households in the US have already installed solar panels and 46% say they have seriously considered installing them (Kennedy, 2019) . Apart from purchasing rooftop solar panels, consumers can also subscribe to 100% green electricity through their utility companies (centralized generation). Many utility companies provide 100% green electricity options at a premium rate without needing any upfront payments or infrastructure at the customers’ end. Green electricity can be sourced not only from large-scale utility companies but also from locally owned community solar programs. As of 2017, residential green pricing programs, which supply a higher percentage of electricity from renewable sources than the state mandate, account for about 10% of all voluntary renewable energy purchasing in the United States (Knapp et al., 2020). This study investigates consumer preferences for distributed and centralized renewable energy options. In the literature, there is mixed evidence regarding preferences for renewable energy options. Some studies suggest there is a negative correlation in preferences for centralized and distributed renewable procurement options. A recent study suggested that customers treat green electricity as an alternative to solar PV but not the other way round in a community choice aggregation (CCA) program (local governments procure power on behalf of their residents) in Massachusetts (Fikru & Canfield, 2022).

33,USING KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS FOR ENERGY PORTFOLIO TRANSITIONS IN CARIBBEAN ISLANDS,@uidaho.edu,Renewable energy transition; exploratory analysis; solar generation; economic analysis; Caribbean region,"As the effects of climate change become increasingly frequent and destructive, small islands are extremely vulnerable due to their size and geography. Islands in the Caribbean are even more vulnerable due to the frequency of hurricanes, earthquakes, and flooding within the region. These islands, however, are in prime locations to utilize renewables such as solar, wind, and hydro. The increased usage of renewables would reduce fossil fuel usage within these regions and provide a more sustainable solution. Solar power is generally considered to be the simplest transition due to its relatively low startup costs and requirements compared to other renewable sources. However, there are several factors that affect how much investment each of these Caribbean islands can support with respect to solar generation including gross domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), and official development assistance (ODA). This paper uses exploratory analysis to determine which factors have the highest correlation t o solar energy production in this region. For this study, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad and Tobago were selected for comparison. Identifying what factors have the highest correlation will help with determining what will be most impactful on increasing solar production within the region. Engineering managers and planners can use these results as part of energy portfolio transition analyses that can address sustainability concerns. Results can also be integrated into resilience matrices to determine the impact of disruption. Keywords Renewable energy transition; exploratory analysis; solar generation; economic analysis; Caribbean region Introduction According to Scandurra et al. (2018), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are at the forefront of the effects of the climate crisis and are thus some of the most vulnerable and often have little resilience to the natural disasters that are often made worse by climate change due to their size and economies . Contrastingly, these islands are usually producing very little of the harmful greenhouse gases that fuel climate change. Caribbean islands are among SIDs, but others exist in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These islands face various constraints when attempting to imple ment more sustainable practices and infrastructure including “narrow resource base, small domestic markets and heavy dependence on a few external and sometimes remote markets, …. face high costs for food, which often has to be imported, as well as energy, infrastructure, transportation and communication,” according to the United Nations (2019). These challenges are further exacerbated by the difficulties faced in organizing development finance on affordable and appropriate terms. Thus, economic resilience goes hand in hand with environmental resilience in many of these islands as was found by Kersey et al. (2021). Solar power is usually considered to be one of the simplest transitions in Caribbean islands due its relatively low startup costs and requirements compared to other renewable sources. Furthermore, with the islands in the Caribbean being located close to the equator, they are in prime position to get direct sunlight all year. Nonetheless, these islands have been slow-moving in the implementing more renewable energy (Shirley and Kammen, 2013).

The enhancement of smart cities will further require an educated and skilled workforce. Government officials take the lion's share in managing the education s ystem in a manner that students leave high school with the skills and knowledge to be successful in post-secondary education or in a technical school. This study focused on dropout rates in selected high schools in Hamilton County, Tennessee. Lean Six Sigma's DMAIC was used so as to provide a unique and repeatable study framework. Data in the form of graduation rates and enrollment numbers were first collected and analyzed using Minitab. The initial data analysis was followed by further investigation based on a survey questionnaire distributed to high school teachers, which resulted in determining the root causes of the dropout rates. The results of the survey indicated that poor reading skills played a significant role, leading to higher dropout rates. The academic performance of h igh school students  is oftentimes tied to how they performed while in elementary school. The students who struggled in their elementary education have a higher risk of dropping out of school even before reaching their senior year. Ensuring increased economic and societal advantages for future high school graduates demands an integrated approach that mitigates the root causes of dropout rates. Keywords DMAIC, Dropout Rates, Lean Six Sigma, Secondary Education, Socioeconomic Perspectives Introduction and Literature Review According to the 2018 PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), which is a series of tests centered on three main domains: science, reading, and math and has become the world's most influential education study, students from China came in first place while students from the U.S. came in tenth. All students need to be performing at higher levels in math, science and reading to compete in the technical world we live in today. In the United States many high school students graduate each year without the skills they need to function in the world outside the classroom. If this trend is allowed to continue, the United States will not have the educated workforce that is required for the management and function of its many smart cities and for the overall success in a technological driven world. Moreover, it should be emphasized that good education is interlinked with good health (Freudenberg & Ruglis, 2007). Disparities in high school e ducation caused by dropouts can adversely affect the future workforce and the enrollment in colleges and universities. Hence, high school dropout is a problem that needs to be noted, prioritized, and addressed with an integrated approach involving all stakeholders, including but not limited to local and federal government agencies and educators. According to the U.S. Constitution , it is primarily the State and local government’s responsibility to ensure that citizens receive an education.  States and local  communities establish schools, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation.  Curriculum is based around individual state’s content standards.

Based on the author’s experience in leading a project management team and executing a spin -off, the need to identify the factors critical to success are needed to be identified. The researcher conducted a systematic literature review in the areas of technical project -based organizations, change, and corporate spin-offs. Results of the systematic literature review are provided and included with the taxonomy of factors, and sub- factors.

Engineering manager researchers may use this paper to help identify the important factors focused on technical project-based organizations during a corporate spin-off. Keywords Corporate Restructring Spin-off, Project Management Organization Introduction In the present, the number of conglomerates are in decline (Nolan, Jin, & Chunhang, 2007; Tubke,  2004). Organizations are divesting to become more specialized, and strengthen the attractiveness of investments (Kengelbach, Roos & Keienburg, 2014; Bergh, Johnson & Dewitt, 2008; Tubke, 2004). These efforts are a challenging endeavor due to the engineering comp lexity in these technical project -based organizations, and the combination of managerial challenges presented (Wiedner & Mantere, 2018). There are multiple types of divestitures: Spin-off, Sell-off, and carveouts. The focus of this paper will be on spin- offs. The intent of this paper is to develop a foundation that can be used to bridge the links between spin- off drivers and outcomes, giving an engineering manager clarity on how they can influence the outcome. Real life examples of histrorically strong an d influential conglomerates breaking up is seen in the power generation business: General Electrical, Siemens, and Mitsubishi. All three have or plan to spin -off their energy business into independent organizations.  In the power industry there is a large environmental threat as the conventional means of power generation using fossil fuels has come in to question and the  market pushes towards a greener means of power generation through decarbonization. These activities are challenging as it involves many levers, and a deep understanding of how the process  will occur, what influence a manager has on them based on the drivers and decisions made,  and what outcomes are desired. Adding onto this difficulty, a spin-off tends to be large-scale, a focus on change is something many organizations are not accustomed to, and the unique features involving different technology integration (Ajmal & Koskinen, 2008; Love, Fong, Irani, 2005). With all these changes and complexities it creates a good area for research, in an  area that is not a main focus when research methodologies are applied (Corley & Gioia, 2004).

36,METALLOGRAPHIC SAMPLE PREPARATION USING ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES,@uncc.edu,"Consumables, Metallography, Sample Preparation.","Metallography is a sub-domain of metallurgy that focuses on the evaluation of the structural characteristics of metals and alloys. In the field of metallography, sample preparation is a key step in performing reliable metallurgical testing. It has been established that inadequately prepared test samples can lead to possible misinterpretation of material defects and nonconformities. These potential misjudgments can lead to large-scale ramifications within a company as well as with their customers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality levels of samples prepared using an existing vendor compared to a prospective al ternative. As a means of evaluation, Statistical process control tools are used to monitor the percentage of defectives and type of defects that occur throughout the process. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to determine whether the altern ative option is a viable, economical solution based on costs and efficiency. In conjunction, these two methods will serve as the main factors when selecting vendors for lab consumables moving forward. The results of this study intend to introduce industry guidelines for monitoring the financial and quality aspects of metallographic sample preparation. Keywords Consumables, Metallography, Sample Preparation. Introduction The field of metallurgy is a branch of materials science and engineering that focuses on the properties and elements of metals and alloys. A sub-section of metallurgy is metallography which consists of the evaluation of the structural characteristics of a metal or alloy using microscopy (Di Gianfrancesco, 2017). Metallographic sample preparation is a pivotal step to ensure reliable metallurgical testing. Literature has shown that success in metallography largely depends on the diligence shown during the pre paration process (Warren, Martinez -Ubeda, Payton, Picco & Scott, 2016). To clearly distinguish structural details, the specimen must be free from changes caused by surface deformation and scratches. Also, in some cases, the edges of the samples must be preserved (Petzow, 1999). It is important to note that, the presence of defects does not necessarily render a sample unable to be analyzed. However, any defects present after preparation will only be amplified once viewed under a microscope. Although metallography is utilized for research purposes, it is also a service provided by many materials testing companies. In the latter case, sample quality tends to be overlooked in favor of metrics such as production, revenue, and on-time delivery. This can prove troublesome because constant misinterpretation of samples due to subpar preparation could damage a company’s reputation, or worse, lead to potential lawsuits. Because of this, the monitoring of process performance is a necessity when providing services with high quality expectations. Even when processes are in-control, statistical process control (SPC) requires that they are continuously improved to further reduce variability (Oakland, 2007). To achieve continuous improvement, organizations must be willing to implement changes whether it be investing in new equipment or e xperimenting with different vendors. Deming’s fourth of fourteen points calls for the end of awarding business based on price tag (English, 2007). Instead, relevant levels of quality should be evaluated along with price. In metallography, the type of consumables used plays a big role on the condition of the samples prepared. New concepts and preparation materials have been introduced to enable metallographers to produce better, more consistent results. Much of this involves eliminating or reducing the use of SiC paper for grinding (Vander Voort, 2002). Currently, sample preparation involves four to five cycles of grinding",uncc.edu,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,United States,35.227085,-80.843124

The chosen model has an impact on system development by promoting or limiting flexibility, consistency, innovation capability, and maintainability, among other aspects. It is i mportant for practitioners to holistically assess the value of each model in reaching their project goals. This research investigates four common life-cycle process models (waterfall, vee, spiral, and agile) through a systematic literature review. 830 quotes from 40 academic sources are used to identify attributes, whether the attribute is being used in a positive, neutral, or negative manner, and how the attributes are substantiated through evidence. Overall, the most positively perceived model from the dataset is agile (83% positive perceptions). The findings show that each model has specific positively perceived attributes. For attributes like Risk & Error Manageability  and Scalability, agile is positively perceived. Vee is positively perceived for its Fo rmality, Standardization, and  Verification & Validation Capabilities . Waterfall is largely perceived negatively as a model, only being positively perceived for its Applicability  to simple projects and for people’s understanding of the model. This research is novel in the application of a consistent coding methodology to characterize the perceptions of these life-cycle models, formalizing the understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of each model. Keywords Lifecycle models, waterfall, agile, vee, spiral Introduction Models for system development —referred to as life -cycle models —have evolved to cover different use cases in system development. There are numerous life -cycle models with different purposes, but four commonly discussed models are waterfall, vee, spiral, and agile. The choice of life -cycle model has an impact on the development of a system through aspects like flexibility, consistency, innovation, and maintainability (Ruparelia, 2010). It is important for practitioners to understand the purpose of each life -cycle model as well as the strengths and limitations of each model to improve decision-making in the choice of model. Much is known about life-cycle models in industry, evident in the large number of studies examining the benefits and drawbacks of life-cycle models, but few systematic analyses have been conducted to capture perceptions of each model in literature. Examining a sample of literature through a consistent coding methodology can reveal information about each model that is not typically captured in literature discussing the benefits and drawbacks of life -cycle models. Our study aims to capture the perceived advantages and disadvantages of each model by addressing the following research questions: RQ1: What attributes of the waterfall, vee, spiral, and agile life-cycle models are perceived positively or negatively in literature? RQ2: Are there differences in the attributes that are perceived positively or negatively in litera ture for the waterfall, vee, spiral, and agile life-cycle models?

38,A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON COPPER CONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,@northeastern.edu,"Copper – Cu, CONFORM – Continuous formation machine, Lean","Copper and Aluminum are the primary and most prominently used electrical conductors for transformers.  Although copper is expensive, transformer manufacturers prefer copper because it increases the effective lifecycle of a transformer and requires low maintenance.  Copper being an expensive material and the fact that it could oxidize easily tends to be a concern for manufacturers.  Hence, to minimize the possibility of oxidization, it is preferred to be processed faster.  Over the years, the copper demand trends have changed as customers now ask for specific quantity defined by weight or length.  This trend calls for a change in the manufacturing process t hat can match these requirements based on specific quantity.  This process is known as continuous formation (CONFORM), but it works like an extrusion process.  This paper compares the legacy (existing) and the new manufacturing process called CONFORM.  In addition, the lean systems introduced with CONFROM, and the impacts of those lean systems. Keywords Copper – Cu, CONFORM – Continuous formation machine, Lean Introduction Copper is an expensive yet fluctuating commodity economically, and manufacturing small quantities with the legacy(existing) process sometimes questions the feasibility for manufacturing.  Copper conductor manufacturing process has rather been a lengthy but a straight forward process.  Lengthy in terms of total number of processes from raw material to finished goods.  CONFORM is a relatively new process and is quite faster than the legacy process. Recently, CONFORM process has become more affordable, so, conductor manufacturers are adopting to this process rapidly.    The major difference amongst both the processes is the presence of interim processes.  The legacy processes, after rod breakdown are diverted to two processes – wire drawing or flat wire mill.  This would then be followed by heat treatment, etc.  CONFORM on the other hand is a rather straightforward process where the raw material enters and you directly get the final product, be it wire or flat wire.  There are major processing differences that m ake CONFORM faster and a seamless process.  CONFORM also introduces a lean systems within itself which would provide better product quality in reduced times. The legacy process consists approximately seven processes to get to the finished goods.  It start s with (1) rod inspection and breakdown, (2) material halt, (3) flat wire mill or wire drawing, (4) annealing, (5) cool down, (6) paper covering either flat wire or wire, (7) packaging and dispatch.  The pay off and take up stands are designed in such a way that the spools are easily fixed on them and the material gets wound on the spools.  Once the spool is filled, the material is then transported to the next respective process with the spool.  The spool sizes are different for flat wire and wires. The legacy(existing) process requires a lot of interim material wait and storage before moving to the next stage which increases the overall production time, lack of free spools, excess material transportation time.  This also results in multiple bottlenecks that cause further delays.  The legacy process also requires multiple dies for the rod breakdown and wire drawing process.  In an economic sense this process is not great if the quantity is small, as all the processes would still have to take place to obtain finished goods. This paper explores and compares the CONFORM process as opposed to the legacy(existing) process. CONFORM has common bases as the legacy process.  However, being a modern technology, gives it a better edge over the legacy process.  CONFORM combines all the methods of the legacy process and provides finished good that directly go for paper covering/packaging followed by dispatch.",northeastern.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

EV has grown in popularity as battery technology has improved in recent years. Consumers may find that purchasing an EV is a wise decision. The low noise levels, drive quality, and ease of use are all outstanding factors that make the case for EVs stronger. The operating and maintenance expense of an EV is only a fraction of that of an internal combustion engine vehicle. EVs have a much higher energy conversion efficiency than internal combustion engine vehicles. Although the EV prices are still somewhat high , EVs are a terrific alternative when various factors are considered. However, EVs are not cheap at the moment, and this is a big factor in purchase decisions, but the trend is changing and the prices of EVs are decreasing with enhanced performance due to innovations in technology especially the charging technology and storage batteries. This study predicts the price of an EV based on various factors that are considered important when purchasing an EV. The dataset will be anal yzed and the price prediction will be done using machine learning techniques. The accuracy metrics of the outcome will show how accurate the price prediction s are and the prediction will help potential EV customers see if the EV model of their interest is reasonably priced. Keywords Electric vehicle, price prediction, machine learning. Introduction The reserves of fossil fuels are depleting all the time and the negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels are also a concern. It is due time for the globe to gradually avoid using fossil fuels and transitioning to electric automobiles is becoming a trend. Electric vehicles (EVs)  have grown in popularity as battery technology has improved in recent years. Consumers may find that purchasing an electric car is a wise decision. The low noise levels, drive quality, and ease of use are all outstanding f actors that make the case for EVs stronger.  In the United States, driving a gasoline - powered vehicle 10,000 miles per year cost s anywhere between 6,229 and 9,887 US dollars per year including operating costs and ownership costs. The expense of driving an EV the same distance, on the other hand, is 8,356 US dollars per year. EV’s operating cost is significantly lower than that of gasoline-powered vehicles but EV’s ownership cost is not as low as gasoline-powered vehicles (AAA, 2021). Many people believe th at the majority of automobiles will be come electric by 2040 (McKerracher & Wagner, 2021). The major causes of this change include rising petroleum fuel prices and expensive maintenance expenses for internal combustion engine cars as well as environmental c oncerns. Although the energy cost of making an electric car is significant, as is its price, EVs are a terrific alternative when all factors are considered, including the fact that charging electric vehicles is quite inexpensive.

40,PROJECT ENGINEERING MANAGER CERTIFICATION: BRINGING THE BRIDGE BETWEEN PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,@gmail.com,"Project Engineering Manager certificate, knowledge domains, engineering management certification.","The professional world has considered certification as a means to measure and validate essential skills. Project management has multiple certifications available globally. While there are multiple project management methodologies, most knowledge intensive industries utilize the waterfall mode l. However, there are no recognized project management certifications that are specifically designed for engineering manager or any other technical discipline manager.  A Project Management (PM) certification tuned for engineering managers would bridge the gap between classic project management knowledge domains and engineering management domains. This paper summarizes the work of a small ASEM project team’s benchmarking work comparing fourteen certifications and maps the content to ASEM’s Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBoK) domains. Additionally, the team surveyed engineering managers to provide practitioners a basis for input to a framework for a PM for engineering manager certification (PM for EM certification).  Early data analysis reveals core knowledge domains that are essential to the perspective project manager for engineering management undergraduates, graduates and professionals . Keywords Project Engineering Manager certificate, knowledge domains, engineering management certification. Introduction In an effort to support the engineering management discipline, ASEM provides certifications, full and micro, for the practitioner on two levels, Associate and Professional. ASEM is expanding their product portfolio to provide additional certifications and badges that are representative of EM related knowledge and skills. ASEM will be releasing a Lean, Six Sigma Green Belt certification by 2023.  Recently, ASEM initiated a project to examine the need for a certification for engin eering managers in project management. This paper presents results from benchmarking existing PM certifications and preliminary findings from a survey of engineering managers and their need for project management certification. Fourteen project management  certifications were identified and selected for benchmark analysis. Reviews of industryrecognized PM certifications from 8 countries indicated that some certifications, while providing basic coverage of project management domain knowledge, lacked related domain knowledge important to engineering managers. To further explore the needs of engineering managers relative to project management, the ASEM PM for EM project team developed a survey to identify domains related to project management that are adequately covered in existing PM certification. Additionally, data from the survey was sought to identify domains that might be developed to further enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of practicing engineering managers, researchers, and students relative to project management. Project management discipline as an interdisciplinary approach PM as a discipline has evolved over the last 10 decades as an essential methodology to manage large projects (Exhibit 1). As the PM project management discipline progre ssed it embraced a number of management components that sought to enhance overall project effectiveness.

Many studies have revealed the benefits of Systems Engineering for large and complex organi zations and projects.  However, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) still lag in implementing traditional Systems Engineering approaches and processes. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is defined as the formali zed application of modelling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities from the conceptual design t hroughout development and other life cycle phases.  MBSE provides a def inite advantage over the more traditional Systems Engineering implementations. Despite its benefits, MBSE adoption by smaller  enterprises has been slow  or non- existent. The benefits of t ools and technological advancement seem to favour  larger corporations. However, SMEs are important drivers of economies worldwide and should benefit from implementing MBSE. E nterprises must perform a trade-off between the investment required for MBSE imple mentation to the possible gains and benefits.  Implementing MBSE may not be justified in the SME context as it is not adequately tailored to the needs of the SME culture, resources, skills, and tools. This paper proposes an adoption framework for the uptake  of MBSE in SMEs whose effectiveness shall be tested in future research. Keywords Model-Based Systems Engineering, Small and Medium Enterprises , Small and Medium Engineering Organisations, MBSE Adoption. Introduction There is no doubt that Small and Medium Engineering Enterprises, herein referred to as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), contribute to the Gross Domestic Product of nations worldwide  (International Finance Corporation, 2019) and could therefore be drivers of improving  economies. Several factors hindering the success of these organizations have been put forward, and attempts to remedy them have been made. However, the failure rates recorded globally are still alarming. A rate of 60% has been recorded in Malaysia and South Africa (J Abor, 2010; OECD, 2020; Rahman et al., 2016; Rajagopaul et al., 2020) , 45.4% to 51% in the United States of America (Otar, 2018)  and an average percentage of 25% in the European Union. Lower  percentages are recorded in  the middle to upper -income nations because it’s easier to access funding with minimal corruption (Gherghina et al., 2020). In developing economies like Malaysia and South Africa, where access to funding is stifled, the advancement of technology in the information age and the increasing complexity of products further increase their problems and worsen their chances of survival. Through an interdisciplinary approach, Systems Engineering enables the realization of s ystem solutions that satisfy the full range of customer requirements (Leonard, 1999; Walden et al., 2015). Systems Engineering, at its core, manages complexity through iteration of the development, analysis , and synthesis of the systems. This  capability is instrumental in managing the new realms of technology whereby products do not exist as standalone but are interconnected via the Internet of Things. As an adaptation to this change, Systems Engineering has been transitioning from full reliance on documents to exploiting the interconnectedness and information sharing of the digital age using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). By using traceable, consistent, error-free, easily shared, communicated, and automated models , MBSE has been noted to reduce the burden of traditional Systems Engineering tasks. With limited capacity and resources, SMEs saw no motivation to spend on deploying traditional Systems Engineering (Hentze, 2017).

43,QUANTIFYING RESPONSIVENESS IN THE VACCINE INDUSTRY TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE PANDEMIC RESPONSE,@fit.edu,"Responsiveness, model, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, supply chain","In the wake of the pandemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) we can look at many aspects of the global response, including social, scientific, and governmental. Current research in the areas of vaccine development and manufacturing find the process of developing a new vaccine takes an especially long time and is unresponsive. Understanding the factors that influence responsiveness can help organizations be better prepared to address the needs of society should another pandemic strike. Responsiveness can be linked to product, process, and volume. The vaccine development and manufacturing process historically takes years to reach distribution for public use. In the face of potential pandemics, learning from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responsiveness will provide essential information for future decision making. This paper will propose a method to quantify and evaluate the responsiveness of manufacturing processes and vaccine development within the vaccine industry by considering various elements of an organization’s vaccine development and supply chain process. We created a model to evaluate characteristics within the supply chain for vaccine delivery. The model can be used to better understand an organization’s strengths and weaknesses in their supply chain. In turn, an organization can be better prepared to act swiftly against a future pandemic. Keywords Responsiveness, model, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, supply chain Introduction Researchers have studied the vaccine industry and found that it has historically been unresponsive and slow to develop products compared to other industries (Moalla, Bouras, & Neubert, 2007) (Rosa, Prazeres, Azevedo, & Marques, 2021). The recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic shows that there is a need for a fast paced, rapid response development process to quickly respond to  global health concerns.  Ebrahim, Ahmad, & Muhamad  (2014) describe that in many industries  fast-paced development and customer driven market s create substantial competition within manufacturing companies. Responsiveness in any industry is linked to customer demand. Customer responsiveness is also linked to product, process, and volume (Holweg, 2005) Though it is unfortunate that the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic has been so devastating throughout the world,  there is an opportunity to evaluate the vaccine industry’s responsiveness. The following main objectives need to be met to be able to evaluate the responsiveness of the vaccine industry: 1. Determine what factors affect a vaccine company’s ability to be res ponsive in developing a vaccine to meet an unexpected high demand within a desired customer wait time. 2. Use these factors to develop an evaluation model to quantify a company’s performance in terms of responsiveness. Some of the many things that need to be considered when developing a process includes, technologies involved, quality control, upstream supply chains, and downstream supply chains. These factors can be quite difficult to consider for a product being manufactured and can get even more complicated when customer demand of the specific product does not remain constant. Considering the responsiveness of manufacturing can help a company better develop a manufacturing process for an everchanging customer demand.  Responsiveness in terms of manufacturing  has been described as, “the ability of manufacturing company to respond quickly [to] customer demands and market changes” (Ebrahim, Ahmad, & Muhamad, 2014) .

44,APPLYING THE PRODUCTION CULTURAL BIORHYTHM IN THE DMAIC PROCESS,@fiu.edu,"Production Cultural Biorhythm, DMAIC, Bottleneck.","The Production Cultural Biorhythm (PCB) has the potential to become a significant tool in every phase of the structured continuous improvement approach of Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement and Control (DMAIC). The PCB is a tool which provides a profile of the daily variation in a critical process indicator through analysis of patterns of variation over several months. In the Define phase, the PCB highlights the inefficient use of a critical resource with modeling of the Real Output Profile (ROP) for comparison to the Digital Ideal Output Profile (DIOP).  A Measure of the inefficiency in terms of production output rate or process yield can be established using the ratio, V , of actual to ideal as a metric.  Analysis of the profile provides direction for cause- and-effect analysis by highlighting time increments where a process is insufficient and allows identification of time sele ctive projects.  The verification of effectiveness in the Implement stage can be accomplished with comparison of the new ROP and V with the previous. The PCB also has potential in the Control phase with continued monitoring of the ROP over time  ensuring t he sustainability of the changes. Keywords Production Cultural Biorhythm, DMAIC, Bottleneck. Introduction The Production Cultural Biorhythm (PCB) is a newly introduced tool which can be effectively used in many aspects of continuous improvement programs.  The PCB provides a detailed depiction of daily variation in a process metric. The profiles of production operations and metrics developed considering the PCB can be used effectively in all phases of the DMAIC approach to improving processes.  This paper  provides background on development of the PCB and details an application within the DMAIC process. Production Cultural Biorhythm Development of the Production Cultural Biorhythm was prompted by the limitation of typically used key performance indicators to provide detailed information to effectively address process performance issues.  The PCB provides a much deeper level of detail allowing for depiction of daily variation in a process indicator . Key performance indicators (KPI’s) are often reported in dashboards or other visual displays on a production floor.  Typical reporting of KPI’s in a production environment is provided by plotting a metric reported daily such as yield, production output, or overall equipment effectiveness.  Such daily metrics can p rovide insight into trends, providing information to establish baselines for continuous improvement projects and track progress to goals.  The granularity the daily metrics does not, however, provide as much useful information for continuous improvement efforts as collecting data in shorter increments. A more refined measurement, as reflected in the PCB, was introduced by (Langer, Gems, Mussler, Wenger, Schafer, & Roser, 2021) where performance data is collected in small time intervals, typically five minut es. Comprehensive data collection and evaluation has been performed in more than 100 industrial facilities with the types and scope of data collection mentioned in (Langer, Gems, Mussler, Schmahl, & Roser,2022) as shown in Exhibit 1.",fiu.edu,Florida International University,United States,25.7553898,-80.3762832779774
45,A 2022 SURVEY OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS,,Engineering management programs; surveys; census,"Engineering Management (EM) is a recognized academic discipline. EM has traditionally been a popular master’s degree, but an increasing number of undergraduate programs have pursued ABET accreditation. This paper will provide a current survey of EM programs at the undergraduate, masters, and doctoral levels. These results will be compared to previous surveys to identify trends. In addition to the overall numbers of programs, a deeper dive into the undergraduate curriculum will be made. Unique features will be identified, such as service learning, co-operative learning, study abroad, online features, and capstone experiences. The results will provide a more complete picture of the current state of EM education and possibly identify new opportunities for programs to pursue. Keywords Engineering management programs; surveys; census Introduction Engineering management (EM) is an academic discipline with its own body of knowledge. In the United States, some programs with different titles cover the content of what would be considered “engineering management.”  Other closely related fields may or may not have a good deal in common with engineering management, such as construction management or project management. This discrepancy creates challenges that are unique to the discipline — there is much less confusion in traditional fields like chemical engineering or mechanical engineering. To really understand a discipline for the purpose of developing new educational programs, sharing best practices, developing standards, and communicating the value to others, it is important to understand the existing programs in that discipline. One motivation for this paper is th at West Virginia University has been authorized to start a new MS program in Engineering Management. The authors intend to offer the results of this survey to senior leadership at the university to inform the development of the new MSEM program. This paper reviews the literature regarding the historical growth of EM. Starting with the list of ABET-accredited programs and the list of EM programs on asem.org, the paper identifies the universities that currently have EM programs. The programs are reviewed in further detail to address key questions. How many credit hours for the program?  How many credit hours per course?  Where is the program housed?  Is experiential learning required, and what kinds?  Is the program mode on-campus, online, or hybrid?  What makes each program unique? Literature Review The EM literature focuses in two directions: some studies focus on programmatic structure and attempt to compile lists of recognized and accredited programs with different titles but relatively common content, wh ile other studies attempt to define the body of knowledge for the EM discipline. Both types of studies were reviewed. Surveys of EM Programs. In an attempt to compile a complete list of EM programs around the world, including programs that had different titles but were substantially equivalent to EM, Kocauglu (1990)  identified a total of 166- degree programs with 17 different program titles and from 20 different nations, 124 of which were in the United States. The majority were at the master's level (99), followed by 38 bachelors' programs and 29 PhD programs.

The connected systems model encompasses a variety of networking communication systems that integrate equipment, devices, and real -time information.  This system of systems performs monitoring and controlling in order to maximize performance of participating s ystems, equipment, and devices.  This research provides engineering managers and businesses with a novel framework to achieve a connected enterprise through the integration of systems operating in silos.   The framework utilizes the sensor network to monito r data in different locations and sends this data to a central location for storage, viewing, and analysis.  The framework further integrates data and systems vertically and horizontally based on the 4th Industrial Revolutions (4IR) principles.  This framework ultimately yields the connected enterprise that integrates business from the sensors on the shopfloor to the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on the e nterprise level.  The connected enterprise enables the business to align each component of the enterprise level KPIs to data produced by the sensors.  This allows business to pinpoint components of the integrated system that yield good performance and those components that yield poor performance.  Moreover, this information yields informed decisions for business process optimization.  The future work of this study would be the application of the framework in real world environments such as manufacturing or mining. Keywords Industry 4.0, Key Performance Indicators, Enterprise Resource Planning, Business Optimization. Introduction The modern trend to digitalization and the drive to use less resources while producing more has created opportunities for optimized systems architectures that integrate and enable collaboration of systems  (Fields, 2002) . Traditional organizations make use of various stand-alone computerized systems. This makes data transfer, systems management, and collaboration difficult to achieve (Misra, Al-Mallahi, Bhullar, Upadhyay, & Martynenko, 2002). The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) provides a framework and various technologies to achieve systems integrations. The 4IR framework encompasses three integration layers viz. vertical integration for connecting shopfloor with operational systems and enterprise level systems, end-to-end integration for creating product genealogy, and horizontal integration for enabling collaboration of business partners to achieve an integrated value chain network  (Rojko, 2017). The 4IR framework can be applied through the adoption of the  Reference Architecture Model for Industr ie 4.0 (RAMI4.0) which encompasses three dimensions viz. layers, life cycle and value stream, and hierarchy levels  (Moghaddam, Cadavid, Kenley, & Deshmukh, 2018). The three dimensions of the RAMI 4.0 framework correspond to integration layers of the 4IR framework. 4IR employs such technologies as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to support the integration of systems within the organization and enable the organization to collaborate with the outside world (Maddikunta, Pham, Deepa, Gadekallu, Ruby, & Liyanage, 2022). This paper introduces a Connected Enterprise Framework (CEF) that leverages 4IR technologies and RAMI4.0 framework to create a system of systems that enables the organization to realize efficient business optimization and form part of the connected world.  The practical construction and application of the CEF are demonstrated and its contribution to business optimization and engineering management discipline is discussed comprehensively.",uj.ac.za,University of Johannesburg,South Africa,-26.18493745,27.99979246435022

The Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) within the VA is responsib le for the planning and execution of all major construction projects. In 2014, CFM contracted a consulting agency to validate their internal construction management through process mapping. The generated process maps have not been implemented and are now o utdated due to the ever - evolving dynamic nature of business practices. This report details the intricacies of the business improvement system created for the CFM which can be implemented to internally validate the major construction processes , ensure adequate follow-on maintenance of the process mapping, and allow CFM leadership to identify offices that are lacking in efficiency. The solution was broken down into four specific components that encapsulate the five solution design parameters and provide useful tools and frameworks for the CFM. Results of implementing this solution design will enable the CFM to evolve into a better organization which will result in an overall desirable workplace. Keywords Business Improvement, Veterans  Affairs, Validation Modeling, Cost Analysis, Value Modeling, Multi –  Criteria Decision Analysis, Solution Design, System Decision Process (SDP) Introduction Critical to The Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA) success is the department’s ability to spread  support for the nation’s veterans throughout the United States. Building and maintaining hospitals, memorial sites, and other types of real estate is integral to VA’s mission. The Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) is responsible for the planning, design, and construction of all major construction projects that incur costs of greater than $20 million (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020) . Thus, it is imperative that the CFM prescribes to a process while navigating its many construction and property acquisition projects. Otherwise, the office will not operate as efficiently as it could and will lose money .  This paper outlines the generated business improvement system that will directly benefit the CFM’s efficiency, op-tempo, level of shared understanding, and transparency. This business improvement study was done in accordance with the Systems Decision Process (SDP) (Parnell, Driscoll, & Henderson, Systems Decision Process, 2011). The SDP is an iterative framework that provides a process structure and facilitates thorough analysis of the project and leads to a candidate solution.  Various systems engineering, and engineering management tools and techniques were utilized to identify the requirements of the generated 4 -part business improvement system. This 4-part system is comprised of a  Project Status Model (PSM), the structure for a new B etter Business Practice Office (BBPO), a guide for a recurring  Mapping Process Meeting  (MPM), as well as a guide for establishing an internal CFM Process Education System (PES).

However, the capstone group experience does not always turn out to be positive for students.  The purpose of this case study is to apply  different pedagogical techniques to counter negative capstone group dynamics , to adjust the student experience and make it more conducive to an overall positive experience.  The study began using a “traditional” capstone group format (four-person group) at the beginning of the first semester of a two-semester capstone project.  The capstone mentor allowed the students to select the group leader and designate roles within the group.  The capstone mentor relied on the group  leader as the conduit for out of classroom guidance and gave the group  great autonomy in development of their group organization and project schedule.  Peer assessments midway through the capstone indicated distinct challenges within the group.  Low morale, misunderstanding the intent of requirements and missing deliverables plagued the group throughout the project.  The capstone mentor adjusted guidance and reset requirements in different ways to try to facilitate  better results.  The group leader was replaced as a final attempt to improve group performance.  Surveys and interviews were initiated to gather feedback on the group and the techniques of the capstone mentor.  The result of this case study identified several pedagogical tools and techniques to improve group performance for future capstones. Keywords Capstone Design Project, Group Dynamics, Mentorship, Student Leadership Introduction Critical to all ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) engineering programs is the capstone design experience.  Indeed, criterion 5 –  curriculum, of the ABET criteria , specifically states that the curriculum of qualified programs must in clude “…a culminating major engineering design experience that 1 ) incorporates appropriate engineering standards and multiple constraints, and 2) is based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work” (ABET, 2022).  It is the crowning achievement as  students take the final step in their arduous journey to graduation.  Finding a good structure for the capstone design  experience is essential for any quality engineering program and requires considerable effort if done properly.  For most programs, this design experience is in the form of a two -semester design project group of students and a faculty mentor.   All programs seek to provide their students an experience that is both educational and rewarding.  The variables associated with a rewarding experience include group size, mentorship and the design project. Literature Review There are several components that impact a capstone design project and, if overlooked, can lead to a negative student experience.  These include efficient group size, effective mentorship, good projects and positive group dynamics (ownership and leadership).  Although capstone design projects have more components, for the purposes of this case study, these were determined essential.  Research has shown that design working groups perform well at around three to five students, while groups greater than five do not perform any better due to larger numbers (Griffin, Griffin, & Llewellyn, 2004).  Likewise, the research also suggests that larger group size leads to less satisfaction among members of the group (Hackman & Vidmar, 1970) .  F inding the  design group balance is critical for a high satisfaction experience. Tandem to the group size, the mentor is a critical component to the overall success of any capstone design program.

With these massive changes comes the challenges of how that innovation is managed to get that research into product and services, how to get those products and services positioned and priced in the markets, and how to satisfy the resource providers that their allocations have been best managed to obtain optimum results in the marketplace.  These pressures have substantially changed the role of Engineering Management in any organization from a governance group to visionaries, from oversight to innovation managers, and from task masters to talent cultivators.   The Engineering Manager is no longer the hands-on arbitrator of duties.  They are becoming those who are training the next generation to think and act in new ways, cultivating those ideas while mentoring a diverse and integrated workforce that does not come from traditional backgrounds.  This challenges the Engineering Manager to be a director and mentor rather than following more traditional paths achieving the next set of technological solutions.   This paper explores this new and ambitious approach, along with tools for success, especially in mentoring diversity candidates so their buried ideas can be brought forward in a way appealing and desirable to well -established and ingrained management structures found in corporations, companies and academia.  The Engineering Manager is now a leader and visionary for a new generation, requiring new thoughts and tools to meet these exciting challenges, and their new role is a challenging one.

Introduction The role of Engineering Management in technology development is marginal within industry.  This is distressing as there is never a more important time for its existence  than the present.  The rapid product and service development cycles, and the demand for new technology to make infrastructure more efficiency is ever increasing.  Although these factors, in themselves, describe the need for Engineering Management, its placement within an organization tends to be inconsistent.  As a result, product and service development can becom e slowed down from lack of coordination, focus, and structure.  This discussion shows clearly that, by using a comparative approach to associated disciplines , Engineering Management becomes the essential link to any successful technological endeavor.  Ther efore, a well - developed Engineering Management department, in conjunction with coordination of other associated disciplines will provide the best logical path from idea to market by championing innovation, focusing efforts, supporting true entrepreneurship, and with a constant focus on the goal desired. Historical Insights There has never been a time in history where the availability of information from any area is more available and at ones’ fingertips than it is today.  The incredible part is, that this availability has exploded over the last 120 years or so, and not an expected gradual increase as knowledge growth appears to have been over the millenniums.

This study analyzes the evolution and state of the scientific literature regarding the linkage between climate change and financial impact for firms, applying a comprehensive bibliometric perspective. The dataset for the study was obtained from two relevant databases: ""Web of Science"" and ""Scopus"". The work looks into the text data by using quantitative methods and describes the growth of publications, main journals, author productivity, the most cited authors, trending topics and thematic maps. The research examines the evolution of scientific publications in different countries of America compared to other continents. Thus, the study explores climate change and its connections with risks and the resilience of firms. Further, it determines, whether events, such as international climate agreements and the recent health crisis had an impact on the amount and type of publications in the research area. Based on our findings we conclude th at research publications on  the linkage of climate change and its financial impact for firms are concentrated in only a few, mainly developed countries, and that research publications in South America and other regions are still lacking although the financ ial impact of climate change might be significant in these regions . Consequently, additional research is necessary to better understand the financial impact of climate change. Keywords Climate Change; Financial Impact; Bibliometric Analysis; Impact on Firms Introduction Climate change is reshaping the socio -economic paths of our time because so cial problems may increase due to changes in the behavior of long-term climatic variables, with greater potential effects on migration and food scarcity, mainly in developing economies (Dell, Jones, & Olken, 2012) . The geopolitical adjustments that determine the path to a new green economy will be the result of various diplomatic scenarios that could dictate radical changes in our societies (Venturini, 2022); scenarios that must be consistent with pathways towards a lower dependency on fossil fuels (Curtin, McInerney, Gallachóir, Hickey, Deane, & Deeney, 2019). According to Van-Vuuren, Kriegler, O’Neill, Ebi, Riahi, Carter, Edmonds, Hallegatte, Kram, Mathur, &  Winkler (2013) , we need frameworks to facilitate the production of integrated scenarios based on combinations of climate model projections, socioeconomic conditions, and climate policy assumptions. A focal point of these integrated scenarios has been  to facilitate research and the evaluation in the scientific community. Hence, allowing to characterize adaptation efforts that could be undertaken by governments and companies to achieve beneficial climate results. Companies will play a crucial role because the change to a green economy will depend on their decisions, processes, products, and services. In this context, financial management must add value to the organization and its stakeholders. The main research question that this study seeks to answer is: How research has progressed over the years in the field of climate change, its  financial impact and the possible linkage of these knowledge areas, in terms of the production of scientific docum ents, in terms of topics or themes of interest, scholars’ contributions, and trends or future thematic directions? A bibliometric analysis has been used for answering this question in this study.",eia.edu.co,Escuela de Ingeniería de Antioquia,Colombia,6.15696005,-75.51685480358233

In order to remain competitive and meet changing customer and competitor conditions, engineering managers should envision the functioning of their organization, from an operational perspective as well as from a strategic perspective. It is for this purpose that engineering managers must know how to tie in thinking strategically as well as operationally, when managing the supply chains/ networks associated with their project(s) or organization. The above phenomenon is now affecting the German automotive  industry, as the industry is moving towards solely producing electric vehicles in the next decade. This shift has caused engineering managers in the industry to examine their supply chain, and und erstand it from a long -term strategic perspective as well as from an operational perspective. This enables them to understand the structural changes that would occur in the supply chain, due to the herculean change of moving to producing electric cars. In this paper, the authors will examine the current status of the German Automotive Industry, as well as Porter’s Five Forces Model and its application to the automotive industry and compare it to an operational perspective in the global supply chain; thus, demonstrating how an engineering manager must think both strategically and tactically, while understanding how the business environment could affect both the strategic as well as tactical approaches to be implemented. Keywords Supply Chain Management, Strategic Management, Tactical approach to supply chain management, German automotive industry Introduction The business model of producing and selling of cars has worked very well in Germany for many decades. The business eco systems were balanced between all the car manufacturers, suppliers, and related activities. Well-established brands divided the market among themselves and provided a substantially growing market capitalization. The rivalry of the different brands as well as the capability of the sup pliers generated innovations and thus competitive products worldwide. The car manufacturing industry is of great importance for German economy and wealth of nation (Hofbauer , 2020). There are more than 820 ,000 people employed in this industry with a turnov er of 430 billion EUR (VDA , 2021). The domestic production volume in Germany was about 5, 120,000 units in 2019 (VDA , 2021). Out of that business the value added tax generation totalled to 82 billion EUR, of which about 52%  are intended for the federal budget in Germany. This equals a 12% contribution to the German federal budget (Janson, 2021). Initial Situation and Problem Formulation It is a matter of fact that innovation and technological changes have a huge impact on new supply, better utilization, modify user habits and affect the overall economy (Hofbauer & Sangl, 2017).

Along those lines, the authors of this paper have earlier proposed a research model, which includes a mapping between supply chain management process steps and entrepreneurial competencies along with proposed training and organizational changes to facilitate the implementation of a more entrepreneurial approach to supply chain management processes. Using a qualitative, grounded theory approach based on two case studies, the authors focus on two industries. The differences and similarities between the two industries will be compared in this paper; thus, showing engineering managers how the model could be applied to the two different industries considered in this paper. Keywords COVID-19, supply chain management, entrepreneurial competencies Introduction Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a well -established field that received significant additional focus since the pandemic started due to all the disruptions it has faced, which has had far reaching consequences on both the U.S. and the global economy. SCM is a field that is comprised of multiple processes, including customer relationship management, customer service management, demand management, order fulfillment, manufacturing flow management, supplier relationship management, and returns management. Since the pandemic has hit the global economy in March 2020, increasing research has been done to study and understand the aspects of the supply chain that have the greatest need for transforma tion and that could benefit from the application of entrepreneurial competencies. The authors of this paper, as part of these research efforts in the field of SCM in a post pandemic world, have earlier developed a research model which includes a mapping between SCM process steps and entrepreneurial competencies.

As technology advances and becomes more complex, so does the methods to channeling and focusing those creative energies on the tasks to accomplish this goal.  Traditionally, Engineering Management focused its energies on accomplishing the tasks tracked by the tools of Project Management.  Today, in the best settings, the acts of creativity and ingenuity are being replaced by the disciplines of Systems Engineering and Technology Management.   Engineering Management is re -inventing itself into a mentoring, guiding, and decision -making discipline that flags those eff orts not appropriate to continue, and guides the best ideas into the next generation of technological products and services.  It is the natural evolution of Engineering Management.  There needs to be the arbitrator in the trade space of creativity, decidin g which projects should move forward and which ones should not.   It comes as a result of too many companies that generate the next level technology and do not get it to market where it will serve the general good.  Engineering Management keeps the best of the ideas alive and the untimely or not cost-effective solutions dormant until more appropriate times.  Driving markets can also be a matter of timing, and Engineering Management decision makers, with the right tools, can become proficient in converting from task masters to innovation sponsors using modern thought and processes, practices and procedures that are part of this paper. Keywords Project Management, Templates, Reporting, Discipline, Tools, Overlay. Introduction Confusion continues to exist about the relationship between Project Management and Engineering Management.  This ongoing confusion is well understood but easily explained by presenting the basic concepts of each.  If one boils down Project Management, it is comprised of a set of reporting tools by which one is able, in a uniform and controlled way, to present the health and progress of any given project during its life cycle.  However, Project Management is relatively ineffective reporting on a Program as, by definition, Programs have a definitive life cycle.  Engineering Management is an ongoing discipline that is able to use some of the tools of Project Management, and provide the thought, innovation, conceptual buildout, vision and oversight to bring ideas to solutions to the marketp lace.  By presenting the inter-relationship of Engineering Management and how it utilizes some of the Project Management tools timely, it will be proven that both are needed but, in its proper time and place. The Project Management Conundrum The generation and management of technology- based programs appears to be at a crossroads.  A school of thought says that it can all be performed using Project Management  (PM).  This is supported with the proliferation of certification programs in the marketplace today  including those by the Project Management Institute (PMI) in the private sector, and the considerable number of foreign certification programs germane to specific countries or regions of the world.  When Engineering Management is brought forward to engine ers as a way of starting and managing programs and projects, it is generally rejected out of hand for these, or similar PM certification programs. The confusion becomes apparent especially when choices are being made to the acquisition of training for employees, and the inspiration to help grow their professional and personal skills .  The conundrum exists as there are no clear pathways or checklists, guidelines or comparisons to differentiate between the standard PM certification of processes",gmail.com,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

A case study of Larry Page, the CEO of Alphabet and Google, was also presented to identify the influence of Page’s leadership qualit ies on individual and organizational behavior at Google, Inc. Furthermore, a research survey and subjective analysis  were conducted to gather people’s perspective s on the transformational and democratic leader’s characteristics. The research survey  found that transformational and democratic leadership significantly increased people’s motivation to achieve organization’s goals. For instance, people are engaged and productive if their leaders listen to their opinion and give feedback. On the contrary, the leaders who apply bounded rationality and do not have a good emotional management technique decrease people’s motivation and performance. In conclusion, transformational and democratic leadership essentially affect people’s motivation and satisfaction in their organization. Keywords Transformational and democratic leadership, motivation, individual behavior, organizational behavior, organizational development, Larry Page. Introduction Transformational leaders can engage with followers to increase commitment and inspire them to transcend self-interest for collective-interest goals . This leader ship style  has four characteristics: individualized consideration , idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, and inspirational motivation (Robbins & Judge, 2017). A democratic leader establishes a common understanding of the organization's vision, mission, and values as well as shares responsibility for achieving the organization’s goals  (John, 2020). The democratic leader encourage s members’ participation in collective decision-making (Nwokocha & Iheriohanma, 2015). This paper reviews Larry Page’s transformational and democratic leadership characteristics which have significantly contributed to Google and Alphabet Inc. He invented the world’s most popular search engine, Google (Djuraskovic, 2021). He earned a master’s degree in computer science from  Stanford University, and his leadership style influence d employees’ behaviors  (Stanford, n.d.) . During his leadership,  Google, from 2012 to 2017, consecutively landed the top position on the list of The Great Global Place to Work (Fortune, 2017). The next section presents a brief literature review of transformational and democratic leadership. Literature Review Transformational and Democratic Leadership The four characteristics of transformational leadership include individualized considerations, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, and inspirational motivation. I ndividualized consideration means giving  personalized attention to each follower, treating them fairly, and providing feedback (Robbins & Judge, 2017). Idealized influence is defined as followers' willingness to identify with leaders' value s, beliefs, and ethical or moral orientations as well as shift from self-interest to higher group aims. Intellectual stimulation describes the leader’s character as being open to new and innovative approaches to challenges . Similarly, inspirational motivation describes how the leader communicates the organizational goals to the followers  as well as inspires and motivate s them to achieve the goals (Lai, Tang, Lu, Lee, & Lin, 2020).",udayton.edu,University of Dayton,United States,39.73845985,-84.17919478013708

The world has recently faced a pandemic, COVID -19, which has presented projects with new and unique challenges. This has forced engineering managers to manage these changes and subsequently look at improveme nts to existing change management frameworks . The paper identifies some challenges engineering projects face, and the change management approaches used to overcome these during COVID -19. The paper has analyzed proj ects in the regions of Asia and Australia to derive an updated change management framework for use in unique situations such as pandemics. This paper presents the findings of a literature review focused on change management in enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the paper identifies the drivers, contributors, and moderators associated with change response. It introduces a new holistic change framework, which will aid project managers in facilitating its implementation within their projects. Keywords Change Management, Change Management Framework, COVID-19, Project Management. Introduction Covid-19 has undoubtedly forced organizations to scramble to navigate the cascading impact the pandemic has had on their operations. Many companies are analyzing their future needs and already initiating a change to reduce (if not eliminate) the negative impact. Engineering and Construction (E&C) companies are commonly used to cyclical downturns, but the effect of COVID-19 has stuck unpresented. The numb er of projects facings delayed  or canceled has been a record high. PWC ( PWC, 2022) has emphasized concerns relating to employee and sub -contractor health and practical challenges about  social distancing on construction sites in their report. Their COVID -19 CFO Pulse survey found that 81% of CFOs are indeed considering cost reductions, and 60% have indicated that they plan to defer investments. Further to this, Deloitte’s report (Houghton & Mountney, 2022) also mentioned that the work might resume soon. Howe ver, COVID -19 has indeed crippled the industry, and a halt is expected about factors such as supply chain disruption, shortage of subcontractors, shortage of material, etc. Therefore, a systemic approach, A framework to manage changes during a pandemic, could be helpful to smoothly plan, implement and execute the shift a project faces in the unpreceded time of a pandemic. This review of existing change management models  aims to identify a revised model based on information available from the recent pandemic. Literature Review Change management frameworks and their evolution over time A change management framework is a process to be followed when a change has to be implemented. It is a process of managing shifts, transitions, transformations , and changes. Such frameworks  are ideally a requirement for all organizations, and choosing the proper framework is vital for their success  (Price & Chahal,2006) . According to Burnes (2004), change is the only constant and is an ever-present feature in an organization. Thus, change management is undeniably an important aspect even in a typical scenario, let alone a pandemic. Change management is becoming an essential skill for project managers (By, 2005).

The goal of this project was to reduce the downtime and improve productivity of hydrostatic testing machines related to leaks in the tooling area in an industrial assembly of hydraulic hoses. The critical factor in improving the results was to  control the processes. Reducing downtime considerably improves productivity and is a prerequisite for profitable and flexible production. Some tools such as process mapping, time study, 5W2H method, and Ishikawa diagram were applied to improve the process. To reduce the cycle time, 5S was applied, and non-valued activities were eliminated. Also, an investigation about the quality of the O -rings was conducted, associated with maintenance activities in the testing machine. All teams received on-the-job training. The project reduced the number of times the process stopped due to the failure of the O -rings. Also, the downtime during the change of the sealing tooling was reduced. The actions led to a reduction of 43% in the stopping time of the hydrostatic testi ng machine. The changes in the process also resulted in a cost reduction of 54% in the acquisition of O-rings. This study reinforces that inexpensive and straightforward actions can generate effective results. Keywords Lean Six Sigma, Hydraulic, Process Improvement, Ishikawa, Hydraulic Manufacturing. Introduction Nowadays, it is possible to observe the increase of the competition in the markets across the globe. The demand from the customers for quality and lower costs are higher each day. Multiple secto rs are facing these challenges, including manufacturers, health care services, financial organizations, service providers, public sector and third sector organizations (Bui, 2020). One of the ways to improve the efficiency and lower cost is to apply Lean Six Sigma methodology. Lean is a powerful business process improvement methodology to minimize or even eliminate different forms of waste or non -value-added activities. Six Sigma, on the other hand, focuses on the Critical to Quality (CTQ) characteristics in processes and aims at reducing cost by reducing variability and achieving consistency in performance (George et al., 2005). Spector (2006) concludes that LSS is most effective in process improvement, and it is widely implemented in the top performing organizations. It came from manufacturing environment and found its way to services. Any organization applying Six Sigma to reduce variation from its business processes will, after a certain period, realize that the benefits begin to fall. Similarly, any or ganization applying Lean will notice a gradual decline in the returns after a certain period. Reducing waste alone cannot improve the process entirely and similarly reducing variation still leaves behind waste in business processes (Snee, 2009). George et al. (2003) argues that service industries can reap huge benefits from the Six Sigma approach. Typically processes in these industries involve significant degrees of variation and the organizations operate close to full capacity. By reducing variation, this will release resources. Lean does not look at variation within a business process, it addresses variation between processes. Six Sigma can benefit from Lean thinking, particularly in the areas of elimination of waste and acceleration of process flow. For these reasons, practitioners of Lean and Six Sigma started to develop the thinking towards a merger of the two approaches and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) was born (Bhuiyan et al., 2005).",stcloudstate.edu,Saint Cloud State University,United States,45.0667,-94.1667
59,THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP IN INITIATING CHANGE: A CASE STUDY FROM AN EGYPTIAN CLASSROOM,@aucegypt.edu,"Change Management, Leadership, Motivation, Students","Building on Change Management as an underpinning theoretical framework, we present the case study of an engineering management course that took place at the American University in Cairo. Over the timeframe of 12 weeks, a cohort of 24 engineers participated in a leadership course and were encouraged to work in groups to initiate change in their circles of operation as engineering leaders. We present the student project ideas as part of the data collected during the study. We analyse the impact of the change initiated by each of the projects and the hurdles experienced on the journey to change in light of the Change Leadership  Framework. The findings indicate particular features that can only be understood when adopting a contextual lense. Implications of the study affect the design of leadership courses in similar contextual setups. Keywords Change Management, Leadership, Motivation, Students Introduction The concept of change has been widely discussed in literature and has been agreeably intertwined across the areas of subject matter expertise (Lauer, 2010). In this paper, we go beyond view ing leadership as an underpinning concept that is tightly intertwined with the study of engineering to look at leadership from a cultural stance (Krapfl & Kruja, 2015). Promoting engineering leadership is arguably no neutral enterprise (Rottmann, Sacks & Reeve, 2014). In other words, one cannot follow the same steps to encourage leadership amongst engineers while dismissing the contextual lens of the working culture where these engineers are based. In this paper, we consider the Egyptian context of engineering management, an area very underrepresented in the current literature. In particular, we focus on the power of leadership to create change and to foster an environment that supports change. To that end, we utilise Change Leadership (Gill, 2010) as our underpinning theoretical framework. We start by outlining how we see leadership as intertwined with change. We then focus on the framework of Enabled Community Empowerment (Ling et al., 2015) as our analytical framework. We outline the reason why we chose the structure of a case study as a methodology for the scope of this project and we discuss in more detail the framing of this case study. Building on our chosen analytical framework, we present the results of the study followed by the implications of these for future research and pracrice. Literature Review: Leadership and Change Existing leadership frameworks have showcased their success in solving day to day business challenges. Yet, in light of an ever growing global oneness business reality, leadership  models are still reported to be at a deficit in view of adjusting to this ever growing pace of change (Ahn et. al., 2004). Focusing in particular on the role of the educational sector to train for and promote leadership amongst successful engineering mana gers, Harreaves and Ainscow (2015) have strongly argued against the model of promoting change in leadership through a top down approach. In their scholarly contributions, the authors (Harreaves & Ainscow, 2015) argue for the importance of change being promoted from within an organisation. This, in turn presents a challenge to leadership training in its traditional sense, which usually is offered to successful engineering managers, such as is the case we report on in this paper. There is hence a need to move away from the stance of teaching leadership models to engineering managers, thereby following the traditional track of equipping them to become successful engineering leaders. Scholarship argues for a need to establish change agency as an infiltrated system within an organisation’s micro-culture. This type of leadership is also referred to as transformational leadership (Bass & Riggio, 2006).

A KE is a focused and structured improvement project utilizing a dedicated cross-functional team to address a targeted process or work area with specific improvement objectives in an accelerated timeframe. Literature review activities included completion of tw o complementary systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and a meta-synthesis evaluation. The broader SLR resulted in the identification of 54 unique success factors. An expert survey is useful because it leverages relevant academic and practitioner experts within the research topic area to help identify and clarify CSFs. The use of an expert survey method is viewed as an effective way to utilize the insights of experienced individuals to help refine the set of success factors. An expert survey also serves to diversify the research sources which increases the quality of a research endeavor. The expert survey results will be used to refine and potentially reduce the set of success factors to be included in a larger empirical field study. This will improve the qua lity of the field survey questionnaire and improve effectiveness of the statistical analyses to be performed with the field survey results. Designing an effective expert survey is key to ensuring constructive data inputs and outputs and to achieve informative analyses. Keywords Kaizen events, Hospitals, Success factors, Expert survey Introduction Kaizen events continue to provide a constructive means  for making valuable continuous improvements in hospital settings. According to Farris et al.  (2009, p.1)  a “Kaizen event is a focused and structured improvement project utilizing a dedicated cross -functional team to address a targeted process or work area with specific improvement objectives in an accelerated timeframe. ” The value from improvement performance  gained through this type of intervention is enhanced when CSFs are identified and utilized by healthcare engineering managers , healthcare management teams, and practitioners to  achieve comparable outcomes resulting in high impact . To identify these important factors, researchers may endeavor to use  a structured, comprehensive, and rigorous process to help determine these factors  in their studies . Research studies may encompass many different approaches or methods to examine a particular problem. The use of  multiple methods that are deemed appropriate and useful can significantly enhance the value of the work generated. Pielstick (1998) refers to the use of multiple data sources, meta -synthesis evaluation, and the use of recognized experts to ensure that res earch outcomes result in quality analysis. The use of expert facilitated research is viewed as an effective way to utilize the skills of experienced individuals (Finfgeld, 1999), and to achieve the diversification of research sources (Golembski and Wojtkowiack, 2020). Leveraging expert knowledge offers a gainful opportunity to enhance research outcomes as key subject matter expertise is directly targeted to gain understanding about a phenomenon. Experts are specialists needed for their knowledge, competence and experience in a particular area of interest when investigating a problem for the development of a solution, or studying an area for improvement (Velychko et al., 2017). The use of experts’ intellectual knowledge to validate the importance of key factors via survey questionnaire constructs, interviews, etc., subsequent to a literature review is highlighted by Rabiser et al. (2010). As these authors relate, experts’ opinions are solicited to gain confidence on the relative importance, relevance and representativeness of items measuring survey constructs. Hence, determining the factors that contribute to hospital KE success via expert opinion is a credible approach to help narrow down to those critical factors that can be potentially studied and validated in empirical research.

Its use is debatable for many in the industry because of varying reasons. However, the COVID -19 pandemic caused an enormous growth in adopting telehealth to provide care to patients. This has proved to be of a substantial benefit for patients and h ealthcare providers as a result of which improving its use became an area of interest for many. This paper focuses on identifying and analyzing the barriers for the healthcare industry to incorporate virtual visits/consulting on an integral level, with a goal of delivering high quality of care. These barriers have been identified from different angles and have been grouped into six categories of people (patients and physicians), organization, tasks, tools and technology, internal environment, and external environment, which are the work systems of the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework . Moreover, we have considered the interaction between those work systems. We have been able to access a survey of more than 2,850 patients and caregivers by Rare Patient Voice for the identification of more  barriers and faci litators of implementing telehealth (virtual consulting specifically)  or the confirmation of previously identified factors . Some physicians have also been con sulted to verify our identified barriers and research findings. We have also provided recommendations to address some of those barriers. This analysis and the provided recommendations are an attempt to overcome the hindrances of virtual consulting and establish it at a more integral level. Keywords Telehealth, virtual consulting, virtual visits, teleconsultation, barriers, facilitators, SEIPS Introduction As social distancing was a necessity during the COVID -19 era, the use of  telehealth boosted significantly so as to attend patients virtually while trying to give them best treatment with the help of technology. However, its total replacement after the pandemic has been a topic of debate for many. This research focuses on virtual consulting, which is a pivotal part of telehealth, and analyzes the effects of its implementation. The effects, both positive and negative, have been categorized as barriers and facilitators in this study. The goal of this study is to acknowledge the status of virtual consulting and whether it can be implemented totally after the pandemic. Using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework, an organized identification of barriers and facilitators of high quality of care and pati ent safety in virtual consulting has been develo ped. This identification will become the first step for the further research in engineering management  to pave a way, using technology, so that virtual consulting becomes as effective, if not more, as in-person visits.

The opportunities that digitization has brought enable managers to make more decisions based on data (Brynjolfsson & McElheran, 2016) . However, organizations still face the challenge of moving from opinions, experiences, and subjective judgments to data-driven decision-making (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020).  Large amounts of data need to be managed effectively and used for the correct purposes. Therefore, the organization must have efficient processes for Big Data and Big Data analytics (Berntsson Svensson & Taghavianfar, 2020). Raz et al. (2019) defined machine learning as a domain about developing algorithms to produce an outcome based on previous data or experience.  The system can acquire and integrate knowledge fed through large-scale observation for improvement without programming. The datasets are then used to develop machine learning algorithms that will be able to predict and make decisions. The four main machine learning techniques are supervised, unsupervised, semi- supervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning requires labelled data for training models, whereas unsupervised learning can use unlabeled data to perform clustering. Semi -supervised learning uses unlabeled and labelled input data, while reinforcement learning uses unlabelled data to maximise a reward (Mohammed et al., 2016). A maintenance strategy is described as a planned way to upkeep assets (Gackowiec, 2019). In the railway industry, the failure of critical components leads to costly repairs and costly line downtime. The implications range from minor financial costs to catastrophic damage to the assets and subsequent loss in revenue. There is uncertainty in the expenses of the repair because maintenance takes place after the asset has failed, and all related costs cannot be predicted (Arena et al., 2022). The delayed response leaves little time available for planning, putting the organization at a more reactive",up.ac.za,University of Pretoria,South Africa,-25.75433545,28.230857806174797

The research project implemented a comprehensive study of community development, marketing, and engineering management systems. An interview survey with a cooperative (Co-op) community grocery store and a local farm was conducted to identify the local foods and the marketing strategies which are being implemented in their organizations. The collected data is the basis to developing the model- based systems engineering for marketing strategies. From this study, it was found that marketing tools and marketing methods positively impacted the customers’ satisfaction. This model will help the local organizations and governments to identify customer requirements for local food brands and to implement an  effective marketing strategy i n food systems in areas around Dayton, Ohio that are food insecure. Keywords Marketing strategy, local foo d, systems engineering, community development, customers ’ satisfaction, food insecurity. Introduction Food insecurity is a feeling of  anxiety about having in adequate resources to acquire foods for a healthy life (Lee & Lippert, 2021). It becomes an endless problem in many countries, and COVID-19 amplified the negative impacts by disrupting the supply chains and food access. The disrupted food access causes a lack of healthy food and surplus of nutrient-deficient food. The insufficient healthy food can cause nutritional d eficiencies. Furthermore, the surplus of unhealthy food can cause serious health problems like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension (O'Hara & Toussaint, 2021). In 20 18, eight hundred million people were undernourished , and two billion people suffered from micronutrient deficiency in the world. Surprisingly, the majority of these people were typically found in rural parts of developing countries, where agriculture is the main source of income  (U.S. Agency for International Development , 2018) . According to the World Bank's most recent report, the pandemic h as pushed 97 million people into poverty in  2020 (World Bank Blogs, 2021) . Increased food prices, limited wages, as well as other pandemic disruptions, such as inadequate access to nutritious food, are degrading diet quality (World Bank Briefs, 2021). Since January 2020, global food costs have gone up b y 30%, causing  an estimated 220 million  people to be unable to afford a nutritious diet (Laborde, Herforth, Headey, & Pee, 2021) To secure the food supply, the governments apply some strategies to support agriculture, such as creating agritourism, providing food hubs, facilitating farmers market, and establishing the Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) program (USDA, n.d.). This paper focuses on implementing marketing strategies to enhance the local brand of farm products and empower local communities in supporting the agriculture to fight for food justice. We apply systems engineering management to develop the marketing strategies. Furthermore, we collected information by interviewing local farmers and retailers to update the actual condition of the food system in Dayton and its influences on customers. Dayton is located in Montgomery County where 14% of the population was impacted by food insecurity and 10% of the population had limited access to healthy food in 2019. The average percentage of the population impacted by food insecurity in Ohio is 13% with a range of 8-20%, and the average of limited access to healthy food is 7% with a range of 1 -7% (Gundersen, Dewey, Engelhard, Strayer, Lapinski, 2021) .

The p roject aims to reduce the cost of energy and asset mean time between failures by utilizing an air motor that relies on reduced airflow pressure while performing at  the same elevated level  as the previous motor.  The project will replace 75 air agitator motors that run on average twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week.  Based on the research in the project section , the company can reduce energy consumption in the  paint shop by 50% by replacing inefficient motors .  Although it is widely known that an electric motor is inherently more efficient, the air motors are safer due to the environment in which the motors are used .  The analysis will include the energy study of upgraded air agitators and outdated motors.  After the installation, the motors were tracked, and energy consumption was collected for six months.  In the analysis of the collected data after the project ended,  it is shown that energy consumption was calculated to be an actual reduction of 66% and a higher equipment uptime for the assets. Keywords Uptime, energy efficiency, agitator, project management, automobile Introduction and Problem Description The Trenzo automobile (fictitious name) manufacturing company is in north Mississippi a produces 300,000 passenger cars per year.  The manufacturer employs  around 3,000 team members , several additional contractors, variable workforce members, and vendors.  The Trenzo  company has set forth an ini tiative to reduce the ir facilities' carbon footprint and energy costs by 2050.  The first stage of the strategy is to reduce the number  of cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air used from each of the air supply compressors and reduce the number of kilowatts (KW) consumed.  The stakeholders for this project were the upper management team, the department, and the company itself.  The stakeholders have a lot to gain from this endeavor to the nature of energy reduction and the need to reduce the company's carbon footprint. As part of the Paint Shop 's commitment to this strategy , they have proposed upgrading the air motor agitators. The air motors are applied in practice to manage the primer, base coat, and clear coat paint from hardening, keep paint uniform and reduce agglomeration.  In addition, the Trenzo Manufacturing facility must ensure that the paint is always kept at a high quality and consistent mixture ; hence the air motor mixer agitators are c onsistently operated twenty - four hours a day, seven days a week. While it would be more energy efficient to adopt electrical motors, it is not recommended to use  blending or mixing paint.  The chemicals used to produce the different layers of the paint are highly flammable , and the potential for an electric motor to create a spark is not acceptable (Arrow Mixing Products, 2018).  The safety factor is desirable because air motors do not overheat, producing sparks  (Martin, 2017).    The use of air motors does  have several desirable advantages. The first advantage is that an air motor is consistently designed to run at any speed (Industrial Paint and Coating Mixing Solution, 2021).  An air motor is controlled by a regulator and gauge combination allowing for flexible usage. The regulator allows for easy and adjust and control of motor torque.  The second advantage is that the air motor is safer than other motors.  For example, if an air motor overloads, it will increase in air pressure until the air motor starts to bypass, preventing damage to the motor itself.  The ability to bypass is crucial since the power-to-weight ratio is 5",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513

It drove a mass social experiment in working from home. To mitigate the spread of the virus and protect employees, many companies shifted to remote work with video calls and instant messaging replacing in-person meetings. Several studies have shown that working from home boosted worker productivity, with the reduction in commuting time being the greatest contributing factor; thus, it will stick in the post-pandemic economy. In addition, studies have also shown that there is an increase in the number of people wanting to work remotely. However, choosing to work remotely can affect people’s budget s. For instance, working from home reduces transportation cost s but many remote workers have seen an increase in their energy bills. In addition, many remote workers paid for home office setup on their own. This study analyzes the overall benefit and disbenefit of working from home and performs an economic analysis of working from home for an individual. Keywords Economic analysis, work from home (WFH), fuzzy logic, fuzzification, defuzzification. Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has created the most sever e health and economic crisis worldwide. According to most economists, there is a continuous  agreement between overcoming the pandemic and balancing the economy  (Pan et al., 2020). To limit the spread of Covid-19, governments across the globe ha ve made preventive decisions to reduce population mobility. In the short-run non-pharmaceutical interventions were applied like strict lockdowns and closure of non-essential busines ses to fight the pandemic.  Interestingly, lockdown had a significant impact on work style, lifestyle, salary, expenditure,  and productivity outcome  (Richter, 2020) . As a result, millions of indi viduals were forced to incorporate work from home  and adapt to the use of online working tools  (Flaxman et al., 2020) . Remote working has a positive impact on the environment due to the elimination of traveling, and reduced consumption of energy on commercial and industrial premises , as well as it,  benefited employee s by saving time on traveling, combining their working hours with family commitments , and higher paycheck (Zhang et al., 2021) . However, the work from home concept was identified with drawbacks such as lack of in -person meetings and informal meeting s during working days along with increased use of home utilities, groceries, and impaired productivity (Al-Habaibeh et al., 2021). According to the survey, the individual with a university degree has a high WFH potential for higher income and liquid assets as compared to the individual with less education in the United States (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Alipour et al., 2021) . The pay scale across the U nited States varies from east coast  to west coast and similarly, the expense scale varies for gas, electricity, and grocery bills as well from state to state (Research, 2022). There are very few economic analyses that are done so far for evaluating how much overall financial profit/loss while working remotely. In this paper, we performed an economic analysis of WFH for an individual with the help of fuzzy logic. In this study, fuzzy logic rules are set to evaluate the impact of COVID on net income change as well as energy, gas, and food bill for an average full-time working individual in the US. Fuzzy logic is of great importance for characterizing and controlling a system whose model is unknown or not well defined. Additionally, it gives a much higher capability for reasoning and decision-making (Chiu & Togai, 1988). Fuzzy Logic The term Fuzzy logic was first introduced by Lotfi Zadeh as a fuzzy set theory in 1965 (Logic, 2006) . However, studies on its implementation started in 1920s as infinite valued logic by Lukasiewicz and Tarski (Pelletier, 2000;",northeastern.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

The EWWTP’ s effluent parameters will be analyzed using the five- step DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) approach to monitor wastewater treatment parameters, find any correlations with different treatment parameters, and, if applicable, identify any assignable, or special, causes to improve quality. ABC Utility’s Laboratory Department provided the 2017- 2021 (five-year period) Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) for the EWWTPs to ABC Utility ’s Engineering Department to analyze the data thoroughly and fully investigate any appropriate corrective actions. Each of the 52 weeks for the five-year period were analyzed using the Xbar-R Control Charts to check for any outliers.  The potential Hydrogen (pH), Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand (CBOD5), Total Suspeneded Solids (TSS), and Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N) datasets were fully analyzed to see if any data was statistically out of control or even fell below the respective effluent limit.  After analyzing the Xbar-R Control Charts, the effluent TSS and NH3-N were not statistically in control, largely due to rain events affecting the samples those respective weeks. Therefore, some remedial measures have been taken to bring the process under control, and the remedial measures have proven to be successful, and the process is now under control. In addition, some control measures have also been suggested in order to maintain control over the process Keywords DMAIC, Effluent, TSS, CBOD5, NH3-N, pH Introduction and Problem Description ABC Utility is located in a southern US state is  located in Jonesboro, Arkansas has maintained three utilities since 1906: water, sewer, and electric.  ABC Utilty operates and maintains two (2) wastewater treatment plan ts (WWTP): the East Side WWTP (EWWTP) and the West Side WWTP (WWWTP). The EWWTP and WWWTP were respectively constructed in 1987 and 1976 to treat the incoming residential, commercial, and industrial sanitary sewer loads in the City of Jonesboro (COJ).  The EWWTP facility site is located at 5205 Ingels Road, while the WWWTP f acility site is located at 1605 Willet Road.  For evaluation of this project, the WWWTP will be excluded, and only the EWWTP will be considered.  Exhibit 1 shows the aerial and vicinity location of the EWWTP. There are two means of sampling: grab or composite.  A grab sample occurs when an operator physically grabs a sample in the field using a vial or a device, while a composite sample happens when a machine pulls from the sample site during a certain time period (i.e. every six hours for one week) (Simpson, 2013).  A grab or composite sampling is determined by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment (E&E) Division o f Environmental Quality (DEQ). The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. AR0043401 gives ABC Utility permission to discharge treated wastewater. The five-phase DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) approach was used to improve quality control of WWTP effluent by potential recomm endations to improve sampling.

These examples show a 100% commitment to a given project or  program, with the entire focus being on the outcome.   As the size of the company, corporation or government grows, this situation becomes less and less likely.   The funding entity becomes more needy with regards to the status of the progress of programs a nd projects under its umbrella.   The greater and greater demands on the Engineering team to report cost/scope/schedule/risk or regular and periodic basis, and also with the short notice to inform some senior partner or manager constrains time and possibly compromises output.  The compromise occurs when staff loses perspective of priorities, ignores data calls and does not provide necessary data at any given time interval.   Engineering staffs generally either ignore the needs of the corporation, or do not ap preciate that the very data requested is the lifeline for their program or project.   They opt more for MBA graduates than those with technical backgrounds, sorely needed in the realm of technology.  This discussion first outlines the complexities of getting Engineering Management recognized by industry.  It then describes and builds the case of the conundrum why Engineering Management is not accepted or otherwise recognized in businesses on a general basis.  Once the case is built out, the conundrum is fram ed in a manner of developing a solution permitting corporate world to see Engineering Management is that bridge reaching both the management and engineering areas, more specifically to the technology area in a way MBA trained individuals cannot. Keywords Corporations, Governments, Application, Discipline, Staff, Reporting Introduction The structure and representation of Engineering Management in Corporations and Government entities is far from consistent.  This is due partially to a poorly accepted pre-conceived notion that structure inhibits innovation.  However, both Corporations and Governments have heavy reporting requirements with the source of their requirements difficult to trace.  These same Corpor ations and Governments simply have not been introduced to the cost savings that disciplined Engineering Management can offer their endeavors without any inhibition of innovation in the achievements of their goals.  They defer to standard Project Management , which is generic to any circumstance, for their reporting and management structures, or they defer to an MBA who may or may not have a technical background for the execution of their technical program portfolios. I f these same entities entertained the mo dern Engineering Management concepts and principles, they would find their own programs and projects easier to track, less difficult to manage, and solutions to issues come to them more readily.  This would be due to traceable processes and space to innovate within given parameters with focus on endpoint and solutions rather than novelty of products or the application of apparent solutions achieved through emotional responses. Engineering Management offers these same entities a path to success through co ncrete approaches that can be monitored and course -corrected where necessary.   This paper lays out the problem in the corporate structure, and proposes a series of solutions to educate and unify the Engineering Management structure in a way of presentation to corporate world to help increase their productivity and boost the morale and creativity of the engineers, scientists and other technical personnel who play key roles in the assigned mission.

Such knowledge is r equired both on the part of the student as well as the co -op faculty and staff.  This important knowledge has been obtained through the TTI TriMetrix® DNA assessment suite which is designed to increase the understanding of an individual's talents in three distinct areas: competencies, motivators, and behavioral traits.  The TTI assessment has been used to help the student in their job search by informing their resume and preparing for interviews.  It has also been used along with cluster analysis to guide t he students towards employment that suits them best and, more importantly, to dissuade them from taking jobs that require major departure from their natural style of work.  The assessment has also been used in the engineering program to gage student mindset, inform retention efforts, and provide a tool for the continuous improvement required for accreditation. Keywords Cooperative education, engineering education, assessment, career mentoring, self-management, process management. Introduction The journey towards becoming an effective engineer and manager in meaningful career employment is fraught with challenges. As a student matriculates through an engineering co-op program, they are confronted with many critical decisions. Drucker (Drucker, 2 008) argues that sustainable career satisfaction stems from an individual performing from strength, doing a job that suits their style of work, and working in an organization whose values they share. These questions are hard to answer even for a mid-career professional with years of experience working in various organizations and roles. To an undergraduate student who is learning the very basics of the engineering profession while managing early adulthood, these questions are extremely difficult to answer. At its core, guiding an undergraduate student through a nascent engineering career boils down to a management problem: self-understanding on the part of the individual; and, mentoring and guidance on the part of teachers and career counselors. Such a management problem benefits from quantitative data and deterministic processes. For this paper, the quantitative data is obtained from the TTI TriMetrix® DNA assessment suite which is designed to increase the understanding of an individual's talents in three distinct areas: competencies, motivators, and behavioral traits. The heuristics are meant to map the characteristics of the engineering discipline/job/assignment to the competencies, motivators, and behavioral traits of the individual. The purpose of the process is not to decide on what a person should do, but to increase the knowledge of the self that can be used to make informed decisions.

In 2020, wholes ale trade distribution revenue was 27.1% of US GDP, with electrical and electric goods making $585.95 billion (Beaulieu, 2021).  Activity had rebounded in the second half of 2020, following the pandemic-induced shutdown of the economy from March to June (B eaulieu, 2021). The National Association of Wholesale Distributors (NAW) economic data showed record growth levels of activity in 2021 coupled with strained supply chain shortages in inventory, personnel, and internal systems (Beaulieu, 2021).

An estimated cost generator is developed by utilizing the known data points for standardized products. These data points will include the total cost per unit in conjunction with generic structural characteristics. The  cost will be used as the dependent variable, and the highest correlating characteristic will be determined to be the primary independent variable. Cost assumptions are made about slightly differing parts containing the same variable. This cost generator tool will be much more reactive to market requests.

An organization responding effectively to changes in its environment  is a problem that exhibits VUCA characteristics. For an organization to stay competitive, having the ability to enact the right kind and magnitude of response to environmental changes is cru cial. To enact such a response, an organization must balance what it does and how it thinks about what it does. What it thinks encompasses conceptual elements such as members’ perceptions and beliefs, and what it does encompasses the concrete elements such as organizational structure, behaviors, and daily operations. When organizational thinking and doing are aligned, an organization is capable of following the intended trajectory from current state to future state without excessive expenditure of resources . However, when enacting the right kind and magnitude of response, it is often challenging to maintain alignment between thinking and doing while attempting to minimize disturbances to normal operations. Although current research has proposed various metho ds regarding organizational changes such as lean manufacturing, they often do not account for the holistic nature of the challenge at hand. In this manuscript, a conceptual framework that provides a holistic set of guiding propositions, by defining organizations as purposeful human activity systems, is introduced to help organizations achieve a balance between thinking and doing. This conceptual framework will help engineering managers better understand how to design purposeful human activity systems that e nable organizations to enact the right kind and magnitude of response to environmental changes. Keywords Purposeful Human Activity System, Organizational Design, Organizational Thinking and Doing Introduction With rapid technological advancements, organizations must be able to quickly adapt to new environments or risk losing their competitive advantage. However, new environments are increasingly exhibiting VUCA characteristics, presenting organizations with what Mingers (2006, p. 201) calls ‘multidimensional’ environments. These environments are often composed of systems of problems, or ‘wicked problems’, consisting of complex interactions of substantively different elements (Jackson, 2020) and can substantially impact an organization’s performance if they are not handled systemically and/or holistically. Due to the strong interconnectedness between the structure, process, and behavior of organizations and how responsive organizations are to these wicked problems , there is an increasing need for organizations to embrace the kind of structure, process, and behavior that can foster the right kind and magnitude of responses to environmental changes. Kind and Magnitude of Responses The response configuration is isomorphic to Ashby’s law of requisite variety where an organization can be successful at dealing with environmental changes if it has a repertoire of responses that are at least as nuanced as the environmental changes. (Ashby, 1958) The kind and magnitude of a threat will vary based on the type of organization, the environment that it is in, and the inventory of responses available to the organization. The structure, process, and behavior that foster the right kind and magnitude of responses to environmental changes require information to guide organizations on crafting their responses to environmental changes; that is if there is a response already or a new one must be developed.

This work will present data from a multi-year empirical investigation to provide a deeper comprehensive understanding of the technical talent pipeline in the U.S.  For data collection, TTI’s TriMetrix DNA assessment suite was used. TriMetrix DNA assessments are used by both industry and education for professional development. The TTI TriMetrix® DNA ass essment suite is designed to increase the understanding of an individual's talents in three distinct areas: competencies, motivators, and behavioral styles. A sample of 473 individuals across three segments of the talent pipeline will be investigated. The three segments include 1 - Next-Gen Leaders: Engineers from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers who have a Master’s degree and are emerging leaders in their organizations, 2 - Next-Gen Engineers: Undergraduate engineering students who are in their freshmen and junior years, and 3 -  Next-Gen Skilled Trades: Individuals enrolled in two -year skilled trades programs such as robotics, cybersecurity , and welding. This researc h will profile the DNA composition of all three segments in terms of the professional competencies, motivational factors, and behavioral styles of the three groups.

Introduction: Multiyear Engineering Education Research and Development Initiative The research finding presented in this paper represent a subset of a large multiyear initiative funded by a consortium of industry partners, philanthropic organizations and state and local governments that focuses on engineering education reform and workforce development in the United States (see Exhibit 1). Specifically, this initiative was designed to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in engineers with the objective of creating a new emerging pipeline of engineering managers. In June 2010 twelve schools from across the U.S. opted into this project. For academic institutions to participate they had to meet three criteria: 1 – obtain IRB approval and meet institution requirements for human subject research, 2 – have a minimum of one faculty member dedicated as a principal investigator, and 3 – be willing to create a master data base for multiyear studies with the goal of peer reviewed publications to support the development of entrepreneurial minded engineers and engineering managers.

73,TEAM DYNAMICS AND PERFORMANCE IN STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT BUSINESS CAPSTONE COURSE,@wsu.edu,"teamwork, team dynamics, organizational performance, capstone course, strategic management, international","Teamwork skills are essential in college and every profession. Students exposed to and trained in team dynamics and performance often had more successful careers. Conversely, students who performed poorly in a team developed resistance to peer and leadership evaluations. A student's performance was further lowered due to  such resistance, preventing the student from becoming a contributing team member. The authors used multiple assessments and critical assignments to investigate factors in team dynamics , the correlation between individual performance metrics , and dismissal probabilities from the team  in a strategic management bus iness capstone course over a sixteen -week semester. Each group acted as a fictitious startup company, simulating contract relationships such as terms, expectations, and responsibilities. A low-performing team member may be terminated or fired based on a set of criteria on the simulating contract. The authors used mixed methods to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. The data were collected and analyzed simultaneously to form triangulation and narrow down potential triggers for team member dismissal. The findings revealed essential  skills and influential factors  of team dynamics and performance . These include but are not limited to soft skills such as poor interpersonal skills, insufficient communication, negative feedback, and a lack of team cohes ion. The study provided a way to give team members feedback before they were dismissed and improve each member's contribution and the overall organizational performance. Keywords teamwork, team dynamics, organizational performance, capstone course, strategic management, international business, and leadership skills. Introduction Beyond traditional classroom instructions, real-world collaborative experiences are critical for students to succeed in their careers and prepare them for complex challenges. After earning a bachelor's degree, most  students are well - versed in all technical skills in a specific major or discipline. They, however, lack soft skills like communication, professionalism, and teamwork. While all jobs require some level of collaboration  in some form or another, students frequently lack prior teamwork experience and are under -informed about team dynamics and performance. Team dynamics refer to the behavioral interactions, communications, and collaborations between team memb ers (7 Characteristics of Winning Team Dynamics, 2015) . Because team dynamics significantly impact team performance and achievement of goals, it is vital to investigate  the correlation between individual performance metrics and dismissal probabilities from the team in a strategic management business capstone course . The course uses a simulation from the MarketPlace Simulation website with a list of d efinitions for common terminologies used in this study. • Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) is an analysis of a company's Strengths, Weaknesses (internal factors), Opportunities, and Threats (external factors). • Assessment On Learning (AOL) is an evaluation of each member 's knowledge of their firm 's specific decisions and outcomes during the last three-quarter simulation. • Peer Evaluation (PE) is an evaluation of team members' performance: peers-on-peer. • Leadership Evaluation (LE) is an evaluation of team members' performance: peer-on-leader. • A Balanced Scorecard (BS) is the most critical  measure of each company's total performance.

74,STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION STARTUP COMPANIES,@wsu.edu,"residential construction, strategic planning, and business plan.","Over 60% of all startup construction companies in the United States ( US) failed within the first ten years. Startup owners experienced many difficulties in the residential construction industry , especially during a recession or pandemic. This paper investigated  the strategic planning  framework for successful construction startups  in the US residential construction industry. The research objective focuses on the considerations and strategic planning before executing a startup business and their importance in becoming  successful in the US residential construction industry. The strategic planning considerations typically include ultimate entry points, financial indicators and forecasting, and budgeting resources. The authors analyzed a large spectrum of quantitative data from various reliable sources . The key findings are that researching the market from a microeconomic and macroeconomic standpoint is essential to the business's success. In addition,  analyzing quantitative data regarding financial forecasting and budgeting helps understand complexities in cash flow and financial risk.  These factors play a considerable role in the success of a residential construction company. To succeed, business owne rs should pay attention to local markets, national markets, lending agreements, cash flow budgeting, and proper estimating tools . Lacking consideration of these variables may result in a high chance of failure instead of success. T his research helps shed l ight on the strategic planning for startups to succeed in the residential construction industry. Keywords residential construction, strategic planning, and business plan. Introduction Successful management and execution of residential construction activities often require  expertise in many fields, including architecture, engineering, construction, design, schedule, cost, finance, law, and investment. As a result, it is one of the world's most complex and diverse industries. In addition, residential construction projects may also use different project delivery methods or financing strategies. These further increase the challenge for startup companies in the residential construction industry. Although there are many challenges, the number of new small startups seeking entry is high in residential construction. Before startup owners align their company with capitalizing on the industry's profit potential, i t is essential to assess  the strategic planning and considerations made by residential construction business owners during the early stages of their business.  With many startup owners failing and lacking a strategic planning framework, the authors propose investigating specific strategic planning and development strategies for residential construction startup companies. Literature Review Strategic planning is significant and critical for executing a startup business and ensuring its success in the residential construction industry. However, Many startup attempts failed due to unprecedented challenges and a lack of a strategic planning framework. In 2006, there were 86,250 construction firms with less than a year of operating, and five years later, in 2011, the total amount of firms remaining from that pool was just 28,608 (USBLS, 2020) . This is a failure rate of approximately 70% within the period. Such a high failure rate among new companies highlights a fundamental knowledge gap between most new business owners and the necessary strategic planning for starting a company in the residential construction industry. Several vital strategies, methods, and considerations found throughout the research process are critical to new business owners when developing a successful business plan.

75,INTRODUCTION TO PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE BASED MACHINE LEARNING WITH RISK AND UNCERTAINCIES: A STATE OF THE ART,@yahoo.fr,"Risk, uncertainty, scheduling, machine learning, predictive maintenance, monitoring.","Uncertain and risky environment surrounding industries makes equipment maintenance planning and scheduling very complex. Standard maintenance approaches such as corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance have been used for long time. More recently, predictive maintenance based on machine learning (PdM–ML) is taking more place within scientific and industrial community. It is preventive maintenance activities coupled with equipment monitoring condition. However, the implementation of such strategy is more complex and requires more financial and technological means than traditional approa ches. Therefore, fully understanding the deployment aspects of the said maintenance strategy and the resulting benefits are prerequisites for business wishing to get in. This is even much more true for metallurgical companies where archaic and sophisticated characters of equipment coupled with highly typical skills of working personnel makes the situation more complex. This work aims to lay the foundations that will support the development of  PdM –ML. The said approach will be tested in a metallurgy company  to validate its robustness and applicability. For this, a literature review is carried out to identify, define and understand the subtleties surrounding (PdM –ML). The concepts of uncertainty and risk are also addressed. A new literature review methodology based on the systematic literature review (SLR) is presented and used to extract the relevant papers. The study reveals that, for the last then decade, the main fields of application of PdM –ML are manufacturing, electric- power, structure reliability. Also, the main goal observed for PdM–ML are failure diagnosis, failure prediction, failure detection, fault analysis and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Keywords Risk, uncertainty, scheduling, machine learning, predictive maintenance, monitoring. Introduction Since the dawn of time, equipment maintenance has always been an indisputable reality in human daily life. Depending on the context, the activity and the goods involved, maintenance can take several forms, from very simple actions such as repairing a light bulb, to the most complex projects such as reconditioning an engine or the maintenance of an aircraft.  Basically, maintenance can be defined as any actions contributing to allow a good to perform the function for which it was designed under optimal operation conditions. As said (Gackowiec, 2019), it is a planned or unplanned way of maintaining devices. At the beginning, with the industrial boom observed in the 19th century, increasingly complex and sophisticated production equipment have emerged to support manufacturers. In order to be able to maintain the growth trend and production objective, more efficient maintenance methods have been developed. In the literature, the three main maintenance strategies developed are corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance and predictive maintenance. The two first ones are the pillars of maintenance and have always existed. Beyond these two categories,  Predictive maintenance has gradually emerged.  Predictive maintenance relied on the combination of condition monitoring and preventive activities (Mikler, 2011). In their work, (Mikler, 2011) used life cycle costing to demonstrated that predictive maintenance results in lower whole life cycle cost of equipment. When it comes to condition monitoring, one of the most used approaches is machine learning. This is the reason why most of paper talking about Predictive maintenance always combined it to machine learni ng. There comes the term Preventive maintenance based on machine Learning (PdM) (Schwendemann et al., 2021) , (Leukel, 2021), (Theissler et al., 2021). While Preventive maintenance is time driven maintenance strategy and Correct ive maintenance failure driven maintenance strategy, we can see Preventive maintenance as condition driven maintenance strategy. Despite the enthusiasm observed in literature for this new come maintenance strategy that is predictive maintenance, questions remain around the latter and its effective usefulness for companies.

76,,@ttu.edu,"Engineering Identity, Professional Identity, Self-referential Identifiers","A multitude of factors are known to affect the ability of individuals to become effective professionals in their chosen field of work.  Identity, the sense of self and belonging, has been and is a topic of heightened emphasis in our current society.  The engineering profession is not immune to the angst and inquiry that this “evaluation of self,” both at the individual and collective whole, has created.  Understanding “engineering identity,” the personal identification with the critical knowledge and respon sibilities associated with the role of being a successful engineer, has become an important focal point in both the education and management of young engineers.  Knowledge of the process by which engineers develop their professional identity is limited.  Some early work has been done in education, both at the undergraduate and graduate level s; however, research at the professional -working level is scarce and in need of attention.  This study addresses, evaluates, and digests  critical areas of concern regard ing professional identity formation, which is believed to be impactful in developing productive engineers and managing them in the workplace. Explored are the factors that can assist managers in the development of engineering identity of individuals that a re new to the profession.  A better understanding of how to effectively manage and develop engineering identity is an important new challenge to the engineering/technical management profession. Keywords Engineering Identity, Professional Identity, Self-referential Identifiers Introduction Identity matters.  Even a casual review of current modern issues —from the social and personal to the professional in modern society—shows it is clearly evident that the issues of identity are in the forefront of social, personal, and professional concerns and cannot be ignored.  From a practical standpoint, identity “also matters because people can be understood by others in particular ways, and people act toward one another depending on such understandings and positionings” (McCarthy & Birr -Moje, 2002, p. 228). This modern landscape has brought self -awareness to the consciousness of individuals , allowing them to explore, question , and develop a more complex sense of self that impacts their mental models and potentially shapes their personal identity.  Thus, traditional roles to which individuals conformed or felt an allegiance to, have lost their valence,  imposing on those same individuals a demand for self - definition that once was the purview  mainly of societ al forces and the institutions within that society.  No doubt, engineers and technical managers are not immune to this societal shift in self, social perceptions and identifiers. That engineers play an important role in an increasingly complex world characterized by emergent diverse social issues that requires their problem -solving skills is  stating the obvious (World Economic Forum, 2015).  Of consequence in this matter is looking at ways of enabling a greater and broader social conscious ness of the problem- solving skills engineers provide to society and the retro-influential forces that are shaping engineering identity.  Such enablement though first requires a fundamental understanding of the psychological factors that shape and motivate an engineer.  This understanding can then undergird initiatives such as curriculum design in engineering schools in order",ttu.edu,Texas Tech University,United States,33.59375255,-101.89959552302756

Recent membership trends show growth in student members, academic partners, and graduate program certifications. New products are being released, developed, or explored, in an effort to increase EM practitioner customer value. However, professional memberships (combined practitioners and researchers/academicians) have been in modest but concerning decline for the last few years. While international growth appears to be consistent, U.S. based memberships are slowly declining. This reality is a recognized threat to ASEM’s sustainability.

Introduction The American Socie ty for Engineering Management ( ASEM) and the engineering management ( EM) profession evolved simultaneously for the most part.  According to Thompson (2009) EM emerged in the early 1950s. T he discipline of EM emerged from several academic programs offering course work and degrees under various titles such as Engineering Management, Technology Management, Industrial Management,  and others (Kocaoglu, 2009) . Pioneers concluded that the term “technology” referred to engineering technology with a different emphasis and different accreditation requirements than engineering . Kocaoglu, as head of the Portland State Engineering Management Program, oversaw the conversion of that  program to a combination of engineering and technology management to “…avoid the artificial dichotomy …” between the EM and TM schools of thought, and thereby have the flexibility to cover technology management from idea generation to the transfer of technology and commercialization (Kocaoglu, 2009). In EM’s early stages, Martino (2009) identified three challenges the discipline faced: 1. Establishing a recognizable research base and creating a “home” within funding agencies to support that research base. Researchers must fit research interests into existing funding programs. 2. Embracing the service sector as a key application domain for engineering (and technology) management. Improvements within the health  and financial service sectors is dependent on the effective utilization of technology. “That is where the engineering and technology management discipline plays a crucial role.” 3. Giving “high priority” to the m anagement of energy technologies. “…it is our [EM ’s] responsibility to make technology work for the betterment of humankind for future generations. Martino (2009) also spoke of the technical and societal problems that where forefront at the time of the emergence of EM as problems relative to the previou s generation and he predicted would still be impacting future generations .",asem.org,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
78,ADVANCED MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT: A COMPLEX SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE,@uscupstate.edu,"Advanced Manufacturing Management, Complex system, problem domain, Systems theory","This paper explores emerging challenges for Advanced Manufacturing Management (AMM) from a complex systems perspective. A narrow view of advanced manufacturing is focused on applying technologies to innovate products and processes. However, the focus on technology only is somewhat limiting. Therefore, this paper explores the application of complex systems to expand the view of AMM  Three primary themes are explored following a short introduction and literature review for AMM. First, the complex systems problem domain facing AMM is articulated. This domain takes a much more holistic view of AMM, including technology considerations, the entire spectrum of human, social, organizational, managerial, policy, and political dimensions, and their systemic interdependence. Impediments of this domain for narrow ‘technology first, technology only’ im plementations of AMM are examined. Second, Systems Theory is explored as a basis to inform a more holistic perspective for AMM Implications of Systems Theory axioms and propositions are examined for AMM implications. Third, challenges for accelerating AMM development are suggested from a complex systems perspective. Additionally, potential mitigation strategies for impediments are developed. The paper closes out with proposed research forward for AMM Keywords Advanced Manufacturing Management, Complex system, problem domain, Systems theory Introduction to Advanced Manufacturing Management Traditionally, products (and the associated attributes, e.g., quality) and processes have always been at the center of manufacturing (Tempelman et al. , 2014). However, this view  of manufacturing is evolving. 21st- century manufacturing enterprises must produce and maintain high-quality variant products using multi-innovative processes cost-effectively. Demands in modern society (i.e., quality products, goods, services, globalization, and private-public governance policies while keeping abreast of the expected traditional production and management concepts-- just-in- time delivery and profitability ) drive these changes (Meng et al., 2018; Thissen and Herder,  2003). Moreover, Tempelman et al. (2014) suggest that the heart of traditional manufacturing (T M) design lies at the intersection of matching design requirements to suitable processes. This matching is essential due to increased materials, designs, and processes diversity. In this case, there is a call for manufacturing knowledge management that enables a structured approach for systematic thinking in response to unfamiliar and changing design scenarios (Tempelman et al., 2014). In contrast, advanced manuf acturing (AM) is “ a family of activities that (a) depend on the use and coordination of information, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking, and/or (b) make use of cutting edge materials and emerging capabilities enabled by the physica l and biological sciences, for example,  nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology. This involves both new ways to manufacture existing products, and especially the manufacture of new products emerging from new advanced technologies” (PCAST, 2011, p. ii). However, the concept of AM “is not limited to emerging technologies; rather, it is composed of efficient, productive, highly integrated, tightly controlled processes across a spectrum of globally competitive US manufacturers and suppliers. For advanced manufa cturing to accelerate and thrive in the United States, it will require the active participation of communities, educators, workers, and businesses, as well as Federal, State, and local governments” (PCAST, 2012, p. IX). At this point in this study, it is evident that a succinct demarcation of TM and AM is nebulous, especially since the term “advanced manufacturing” can encompass any developmental changes in recent times in",uscupstate.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

For this study, three years of aggregate data were collected for multiple VA medical centers in different regions in the US and analyzed using a multiple linear regression analysis. Twenty input variables were taken into account to determ ine how they affect the t otal clinic cost of VA. The results show that factors such as the p hysician clinical full time equivalent employee, facility c omplexity, number of r esidents, productivity, and associate providers per physician can significantly affect the total clinic cost of VA for O ptometry services. Keywords Veterans Affair; Total Clinic Cost, Optometry; Multiple Linear Regression. Introduction COVID-19 has increased pressure on highly complex and expensive healthcare system, making it more urgent to lower costs across the globe. Today, tightening up on overspending is urgent to help stretch medical and hospital resources more than ever. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is America’s largest comprehensive healthcare system, serving 9 mill ion enrolled Veterans each year (Administration , 2008). With its expansion, more veterans are choosing to receive their health care at VA. Hence,  the focus on improving clinical efficiency and highly efficient cost models ha ve become critical to serve large volume of incoming patients.  Eye care services are no exception when it comes to cost control. Within the Office of Specialty Care Services in the Office of Patient Care Services at VA Central Office, Optometry and Ophthalmo logy are equal partners working together to provide the full spectrum of eye care services (Committee, 2017). The presented study focuses on the Optometry Services related costs only. The Veterans Health Administration is divided into areas called Veteran s Integrated Service Networks (VISN). Each VISN has a group of facilities in them. There are approximately 134 locations where veterans can receive eye care services across the nation. These clinics are highly variable in staffing models, the complexity of services, performance measures, student training programs, customer satisfaction, and numbers of Veterans served. For this study, we have covered all 134 facilities for the analysis. With multiple factors in consideration, it becomes unclear what combinat ions of factors should be utilized to deduce their impact on Total Clinic Cost. Hence, this study has been designed to describe and assess the factors contributing to the cost implications for the delivery of eye care services by optometrists within the VA organization. According to Ntsoane and Oduntan (2010), there are three primary factors namely, availability, affordability and accessibility of eye care services which influences the prevention of visual impairment worldwide.

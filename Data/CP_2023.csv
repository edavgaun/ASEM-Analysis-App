0,MANAGING PEER EFFECTS FOR EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE: A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES ON PEER EFFECTS,@oregonstate.edu,"Peer effects, social learning, comparison, workplace performance, employee performance.","Peer effects are effects caused by a reference person  or group which affects a focal person or group. Research has shown that peer effects exist in the workplace, and it affects employee performance. The current study’s objective is to explore how managers and organizations can leverage peer effects to improve workplace performance. The current study aimed at showing how managers can identify and induce peer effects, as well as informing them on the expected average performance outcomes due to peer effects. A literature review on empirical studies that tested for peer effects on performance was conducted and  organized so that the included studies showed how they identified and induced peer effects, as well as their effects on average performance. The results showed that peer effects can be present in environments that allow comparison  and social learning  between employees . Peer effects were found to have heterogenous effects on peer effects depending on the context or situation. The current study suggests that managers should first thoroughly understand the context or situation in which they want to induce peer effects since peer effects may increase or decrease average performance. Keywords Peer effects, social learning, comparison, workplace performance, employee performance. Introduction Social contagion and p eer effects research began in the last two centuries in psychology field when Triplett (1898) observed that cyclists rode faster against other cyclists compared to when they rode without other cyclists (Villeval, 2020). Peer effects research has since evolved and extended into other fields including management, economics, and education (Villeval, 2020).  In education,  peer effects  research suggests that  a student ’s level of engagement is influenced by their peer’s behaviors (Steenberghs et al. 2021). Peers also affect student’s classroom attention (Felmlee et al. 1985) and grades (Sacerdote, 2011). In economics, peer effects are used to understand policy outcomes  and economic behavior. For example, when designing policies or procedures for alcohol education and recovery, Perkins and Berkowitz (1986) found that people rarely admit and seek help from their peer group because they fear judgement even when their peers do not judge them. Perkins and Berkowitz (1986) suggested that policies or recovery procedures should include sharing and communication with peers  in an effort to break this misperception . In management, peer effects are used as tools to understand or improve a current level of organization performance and culture.  Rosaz (2016) found that an employee’s quitting time is influenced by their peer’s quitting times. Liang et al. (2018) suggest that an employee ’s safety violations can be influenced by their coworker’s safety violations . Multiple studies have suggested that an employee’s performance is influenced by their peer’s performance (e.g., Falk and Ichino, 2006; Mas and Moretti, 2009; Azoulay et al., 2010) Research on peer effects for performance has piqued the interest of organizations and managers since they provide an additional means for them to improve and achieve their desired level of performance ( Villeval, 2020). However, conclusions on using  peer effects for performance improvement is heterogenous depending on the context . Studies have shown that peer effects  can have at least both a po sitive effect on performance su ch that average individual performance increases in the presence of peer  effects compared to when peer effects are absent (Mas and Moretti 2009; Kuhnen and Tymula, 2012; Li et al., 2022) , and a negative effect on performance such that average individual",oregonstate.edu,Oregon State University,United States,44.56305595,-123.28392337694638
1,MIDDLE MANAGEMENT DYNAMICS AND PURPOSEFUL CAREER AGENCY: A SYSTEMS THINKING APPROACH,@oregonstate.edu,"Middle Management, Human Career Agency, Systems Thinking, Ontology","The success of an engineered system is contingent on the system’s parts working harmoniously in a stable configuration over time. In organizations, this depends on both concrete systems such as machines, tools, and buildings, and conceptual systems such as organizational culture, hierarchy, and power dynamics. When seeking to achieve stability within their managed systems, engineering managers navigate many organizational contexts and employee interactions that occur rapidly, and often simultaneously. This is especially true when considering engineering managers in middle management. The middle management perspective has evolved to be of great importance, as middle managers have been recognized as instrumental to the successes or failures of organizations and organizational initiatives. Research agrees that barriers to middle management success include motivation loss exhibited as burnout or cynicism, or individual struggles to reclaim lost agency. Middle management research has recognized that core tenets of middle management are rooted in practices that limit human career agency, which can create paradoxes between successful characteristics of middle managers and humans. To explore this phenomenon, we define career agency of engineering managers as purposeful human activity systems. Of particular interest is understanding middle management agency, as barriers to middle management’s efficacy can holistically affect organizational initiatives through their central positioning in organizations. In this research, we propose a systemic ontology of career agency, which identifies current barriers to successful career agency. Future research will translate this ontology into operable tools for engineering managers to examine, assess, and reconcile the tension between middle management directives and career agency. Keywords Middle Management, Human Career Agency, Systems Thinking, Ontology Introduction The middle management position is widely  recognized as an integral contributor to the successes or failures of organizations throughout management literature  (Gunnarsdóttir, 2016; Hortovanyi et al., 2021; Huy, 2002; Rudes, 2012). The role  is also rooted in paradox , as core integrants of the position include 1) being both managers and managed, often simultaneously  (Floyd & Wooldridg e, 1992), 2) being both agents of change and the recipients of change initiatives  (Balogun, 2003) , and 3) being integral to the successes and failures of organizations while encountering role inconsistencies and lack of empowerment (Wilkinson & Calvo -Amodio, 202 3). Due to the paradoxical nature of the roles and circumstances of the role, the middle management position faces a possible reduction of authority and sense of self (Gjerde & Alvesson, 2020), which can have many advers e effects on organizational productivity and diminish the importance of the middle management role. The concept of purposeful career agency is particularly at odds when considering these reductions in authority and sense of self . Purposeful career agency in this research refers to an agent’s ability to exert control over their surrounding circumstances or act in ways in which agents perceive themselves to be effectively pursuing their personal career goals while acting with forethought towards long-term career goals or successes (Lam & De Campos, 2015) . Purposeful career agency has been referred to by many names throughout research, which often omit specific dimensions of other references, such as “strategic agency” (Mantere, 2007), “autonomy” (Gunnarsdóttir, 2016), and having a “protean career” (Hall, 2004). However, the driving desire of humans to control their career s and contribute to their careers in ways meaningful to them remains constant. There is an inherent human desire, the desire to exercise a certain level of control over their lives, that can be fundamentally at odds with the middle management  job title as its core principles  run counter to",oregonstate.edu,Oregon State University,United States,44.56305595,-123.28392337694638
2,EMBOK 5.0 – INDUSTRY 4.0/5.0 MANIFEST AND LATENT DIMENSIONS MAPPING TO THE ASEM EMBOK,@odu.edu,"EMBOK, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Cyber-Technical-Socio Systems.","Industry 3.0 automation emerged replacing human labor with high volume processes and robotics.  Industry 4.0, cyber- physical systems, and Industry 5.0, mass customiza tion and cognitive systems, are in the early stages of emergence. Research into the impact of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 is focused at the strategic or organizational levels or on the technological challenges.  Research into the impact of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 o n engineering management has been limited to their impact on project management.  This leaves open the question of the directions in which ASEM should evolve the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK) under the emergence of Industry 4.0 and 5.0. This paper reports an initial mapping of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 onto future EMBOK cyber-technical-socio engineering management systems.  The research method began with the Boston Consulting Group nine technologies of Industry 4.0 (2015) and added the Indust ry 5.0 technologies of cobots, smart machines, block chain, virtualization, hyper - intelligent networking, genetic engineering, and quantum computing as the initial conceptual framework.  Key word searches were performed, and a corpus of journal articles wa s assembled within each technology.  Content analysis was performed on the corpora to identify manifest and latent cyber-technical-socio dimensions.  The manifest and latent dimensions were mapped to the domains of the ASEM EMBOK.  The mappings provide the basis of a proposed theoretical framework for researching revisions to the ASEM EMBOK, which is termed EMBOK 5.0. Keywords EMBOK, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Cyber-Technical-Socio Systems. Introduction While some of the nine Industry 4.0 technologies (Boston Consulting Group, 2015) have evolved out of Industry 3.0 automation (additive manufacturing, data analytics, robots, simulation, the Internet, and cybersecurity), others such as augmented reality, cloud computing, and massive horizontal and vertical system integration are more recent innovations.  To assist its industries with digitalization, the German government presented its future high-technology strategy at Hannover Messe  in 2006 and established an advisory working group to develop innovation policy.  The working group presented its Industry 4.0 innovation policy proposal at the Hannover Fair in 2011 as a roadmap for German manufacturing to remain competitive in the  future global marketplace.   Industry 4.0 was adopted by the German government with a focus on development of new business models based on cyber-physical systems.  Industry 4.0 business models achieve competi tive advantage through individualized product customization, inclusion of customers and stakeholders in value creation from design to use, and horizontal-vertical integration of the production and delivery of smart products and services. Two significant events occurred in 2017 initiating the parallel development of Industry 5.0.  Society 5.0 emerged from a Japanese government program launched in 2013 to revitalize its economy through evolution of smart human - centered society.  The program was  revised annually until 2017 when it was formally released as Society 5.0.  In parallel, the United Nations General Assembly established Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 with objectives of building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable indus trialization, and fostering innovation.  In 2017, the United Nations alter ed its Charter of Corporate Behavior to drive implementation of its Sustainable Development Goals proactively through integration with Society 5.0.  From 2017 to 2021, there were dis persed academic research initiatives into the structure and implementation of what was then termed the Fifth Industrial Revolution.  The European Commission held virtual workshop discussion among its funding agencies, research organizations, and technology providers from July 2 to 9, 2020.  Out of these workshops, the European Commission developed and released the document Industry 5.0: Towards a Sustainable, Human -centric, and Resilient European Industry  in January 2021.

3,TEAM BUILDING ASSEMBLY GAME: WINS,@gmail.com,"Team structure, time management, leadership style, learning rate, knowledge level, creativity index, competition.","This paper describes a set of board games designed for the analysis of personal traits and the collective potential of a team. The objective of the games is to assemble verbal, pictorial and/or structural products out of basic elements such as words or blocks. We have designed tools for tracking a team’s manager’s time. This tracking is required for the quantification of self-regulation and leadership. Although it is possible to record a team’s work using external specialists, rather than as a simulation, this can lead to inaccuracies such as the impact of the observer effect. Alternatively, we offer a series of simulations where team members solve challenges directly. Other players record the time and frequency of actions, interactions and then rotate roles. At the end of each round of a game, participants analyze their learning rates, knowledge and creativity. By recording the times and frequencies of the decision making for Control, Direction, Instruction or Coordination, we can define a manager's leadership style. A team consists of seven to eight participants: two Workers supply an Assembler under the leadership of a Manager. Another three members play the roles of Quality Controllers and keep records. Said processes can be optimized by defining micro- elements of mental operations of active members and the decisions of the manager. At least two teams need to participate in the game for optimal results. This specific paper is limited to the “WinS'' simulation, please reach out to Bazil for information on other simulations. Keywords Team structure, time management, leadership style, learning rate, knowledge level, creativity index, competition. Introduction The fundamental idea of Frederic Taylor's Scientific Management was a time-and-motion study for optimizing the micro-elements of manual labor. This was used to construct the best chain of production (Taylor, 1911). Throughout the 20th century, this correlated into organizing mass industrial production by individual laborers. At the beginning of the 21st century, especially in the US, an intellectual work force was often prevalent. This simulation can just as easily be utilized for teams that provide services such as consulting. The idea of WinS was taken from the same name exercise proposed for operation management classes (Heineke & Meile, 1995). Some of the exercises in building different paper products were developed into games around a table by introducing roles, the recording of time, analysis and presentations by players (Bazil, 2012). This team structure can be optimized by defining micro-elements of mental operations for members of a team and the decisions of the team's manager. We developed a set of statistical and analytical tools for recording the time required for the self-regulation of team members and the time spent by the manager. As a basic teamwork cell, we offer a structure of 2 WORKERS supplying the ASSEMBLER under the leadership of a MANAGER. The final product of a contemporary job might be a physical object or a completed service combining manual and intellectual elements. For example, a surgeon performs an operation with the assistance of two nurses, or a specialist assembles a car with the help of two assistants. Accordingly, we developed series of business games for the simulation and measurement of team operations [Bazil, 2012]: - WinS (Words-in-Sentences) – verbal creativity - JinS (Jigsaw-in-Set) – 2-dimensional imagination - LinS (LEGO-in-Structure) –  3-dimensional designs Corporate training centers can develop specialized simulation based on WinS or the other games that reflect their industrial technology and processes.

However, there are limits to how much change firms can handle, or even notice before it’s too late. This article will trace the evolution of change along the lifecycle in the hi-tech industry and identify the extent firms can cope with the frequency, magnitude, and cumulative effects of change. This article will also describe the different types of change that occur in markets, the natural market impediments that can hinder a firm’s ad aptation. Essentially, it will explore how firms manage change in relation to the market, which can range from hardly discernible change like the whisper change signal to internal stress factors that induce unnecessary change. Likewise, we will map the response to chang e during with the market transients, which can influence a firm’s adaptive process and survivability. A key contribution of this paper is the introduction of two methods  that can be utilized by firms to measure the nature, expected magnitude, and the directionality of pending change required for effective strategic adaptation. One method focuses on the SPACE tool for mapping the situation of the firm in its market environment. The second method, CVGA, maps the firm in its targeted multi-dimensional competitive space to reveal the dangers it faces from elements like insufficient competitor knowledge, internal executive misalignments, and the misdirection of investments to achieve competitive value. Keywords Management of change, hi-tech, change signal, market change , clockface, change affecting firms, life cycle theory , SPACE, CVGA. Introduction The high technology (hi-tech) industry refers to firms that implement or in some capacity utilize the most recent and advanced forms of technology available within the market, which is also known as cutting-edge technology. This form of technology can be regarded as the most disruptive and complex technology -based phenomenon occurring within the market space. Amongst t he most vital survival mechanisms a firm can utilize is its ability to intercept change signals, interpret market change, and assess its capability to react to it. The preponderance of a firm’s success depends on its capability to adjust to and cope with incessant changes in its relevant market environment(s). Overall, firms will contend with three sources of change that can originate from within the firm itself, from within the market(s), and/or from outside of it. Furthermore, to maximize long-term success firms must be mindful of the four types of change signal s that can occur, which include : t he normal type, that are due to predictable changes during the market lifecycle as in the convergence of firms to standard platforms during the market high growth phase; the whisper type, that originate from",uqo.ca,Université du Québec en Outaouais,Canada,45.42226325,-75.73909824426678
5,DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENGINEERING PROJECT MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION,@ecu.edu,"Engineering Project Manager, Engineering Projects, Certification, Body of Knowledge, ASEM.","In an effort to expand ASEM products and services specifically for engineering managers, the Society seeks opportunity to identify and develop niche opportunities that support the engineering manager professional. Recent changes to the PMBoK have provided space for a certification for engineering managers engaged in project management. A specific engineering certification would provide a standardized and recognized benchmark of the skills, knowledge and experience required to effectively manage engineering projects and to clarify advancement of one’s professional path. In addition, a certification program based on a specific body of knowledge could ensure that engineering project managers are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to successfully lead engineering projects. By establishing a rigorous and respected certification, engineering project management could be seen as a distinct and valuable career path providing benefits for both employers and professionals. A group of practitioners, subject matter experts and researchers began collaboration on development of such a certification with particular emphasis on the management of engineering projects or EPM. The projected certification will be aimed at engineering project management branches across knowledge-intensive industries. This paper reports on the work and progress of this development effort. Keywords Engineering Project Manager, Engineering Projects, Certification, Body of Knowledge, ASEM. Introduction Based on gathered evidence from related management  knowledge bases, the development and implementation of an engineering project management certification is  expected to provide benefits to academics, practitioners, and organizations. Certification credentials are sought by job seekers as a primary form of acquiring specific knowledge or skills.  Certification credentials are recognized by  recruiters and employers as a demonstrated commitment to continuous professional development and technical competence. Broadly, certifications are designed to demonstrate formal training and in-depth learning with the aim of advancing specific skill sets for performing job related tasks and for increasing employability (Hunsinger & Smith 2009) . Organizations use certifications to improve productivity (Hitchcock 2007, Mbise 2021). Recognized benefits of certifications include: 1) unbiased and reliable means to validate knowledge and professional experience, (2) higher pay and compensation, (3) increase and enhance career opportunities, (4) expand professional network, (5) gain compe titive advantage and marketability, (6) demonstrate commitment of professional growth, (7) get recognition and credibility as an experience d professional, (8) become part of a bigger community and get access to networking opportunities (Mahaney & Greer 2004).

6,LITHIUM BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN AND GREEN INITIATIVES,@ecu.edu,"Cobalt, EV Battery, Lithium, LIB, Nickel, Graphite","This paper provides a non-exhaustive summary review of publications exploring the interrelationships of the lithium battery supply chain and green energy initiatives. Lithium mining operations, processing, and distribution are uniquely concentrated and can impact green initiatives related to energy storage and use. Energy for the transportation sector has emerged as a key target for policy makers intent on reducing the global carbon footprint. This summary review finds that for the most part, battery raw materials supplies are adequate through 2030 with caveats related to geo - politics. Nickel and graphite represent long term supply chain risks. The current cobalt supply chain is an ongoing source of environmental risks and damage.  It is incumbent on policy makers to look beyond current carbon impacts by developing a strategic understanding of the supply chain. The results also indicate that while policy makers pursue green energy the Tragedy of the Commons paradigm is emerging. Keywords Cobalt, EV Battery, Lithium, LIB, Nickel, Graphite Introduction As the world stampedes towards a zero carbon or carbon neutral environment, more attention is being given to alternative and renewable energy sources and economies with reduced carbon impacts. Exhibit 1 shows an example of how governments of many nations are establishing strategies, goals, and mandates to address energy environmental and climate challenges directed towards sustainable energy policies (Sun, Liu, Zhao, Hao, 2021).  And, while many countries seeking to alter their carbon footprint rely heavily on raw materials from foreign sources (Sun, Liu, Zhao, Hao, 2021) they also insist on local interests to the detriment of global environmental and climate security. Instability in a raw material supplying country can have appreciable impacts on the supply chain that delivers those materials to demand countries (Gettleman, 2012). Electric vehicles (EVs) have risen to the forefront as the prime initiative to reduce contributions to greenhouse emissions.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) finds that EV registrations increased 60% between 2014 and 2019 and estimated 7.2 million EVs were in use in 2020 (IEA, 2020b). Interestingly, about half of the world’s EVs in use are in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The IEA estimates that by the year 2030 there will 140 million EVs used in transportation globally (IEA, 2020b). This growth represents a significant impact on the supply of EV energy sources.

7,RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES USING EXPERT OPINIONS AND THE EV TECHNIQUE,@uaeu.ac.ae,"Construction projects, duration risks, cost risks, earned value technique, expert opinions, risk management.","Construction projects are complex and involve thousands of details and diverse interrelationships among parties. Different participants from different disciplines are involved in construction projects and may be fragmented in various geographic locations. This fragmentation and multidisciplinary nature of the construction industry makes it one of the most risky industries. The risk associated with construction projects require proper management. This involves careful risk identification, assessment, analysis, and response. Risk management of construction activities is one of the most difficult tasks and risk assessment and analysis, in particular, are considered as the most difficult components of the risk management process. However, the outcome of this task normally provides fruitful benefits. This study elicits the feedback of construction experts to identify risks, determine the likelihood of these risk to happen, prioritize them, and estimate the degree of their impact. A spreadsheet mechanism will then be presented to assess, analyze, and evaluate identified risks and measure the impact and severity of high priority risks on the project’s duration and cost. The earned value technique will then be used to measure the schedule and cost progress and estimat e the project’s cost at completion considering the effect of the identified risks in order to provide an idea on how these risks may affect the project’s bid price. The proposed spreadsheet mechanism is expected to help construction practitioners identify the most severe risks and measure their effect on the project’s duration and cost. The study will then provide recommendations to mitigate risks with high impact and severity. Keywords Construction projects, duration risks, cost risks, earned value technique, expert opinions, risk management. Introduction and Literature Review Every construction project has risk and there are no risk-free projects. Construction project risks should not be ignored and should be managed to minimize, share, transfer, o r accept them (Taroun, 2014). Construction projects are risky due to their complexity and multidisciplinary nature. It involves a large number of stakeholders, numerous details, and relatively long durations, entailing significant interactions and interrel ationships between internal and external parties. These organizational and technological complexities generate a large number of risk events. When compared with other industries, it is well known that the construction industry has a poor reputation history in risk management. In construction projects, the focus of risk management has traditionally been on quantitative risk assessment, despite the difficulties associated with obtaining objective and realistic frequencies and probabilities (Taroun, 2014). Thi s is true because every construction project is unique by nature and this fact is a main driver behind relying on subjective probabilities rather than having objective likelihoods. Even when estimating contingencies in construction projects, a subjective and approximate percentage of risk is usually added when estimating projects bid prices. This subjective judgment of estimators using their rule-of-thumb procedures to estimate risks is not enough and needs to be structured for a better risk assessment and management. Historically, the concept of risk was first addressed more than 2400 years ago when the Greek used to assess risks before making decisions (Aven, 2016). Risk analysis of construction projects, in particular, has its roots since the development of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) in the 1950s for evaluating uncertainty in activity durations of projects. Principles and methods were developed to conceptualize, assess and manage risk. These principles and methods still represent, t o a large extent, the foundation of this field today, but many advances have been made, linked to both the theoretical platform and practical models and procedures. However, risk assessment and management as a field is considered relatively young (Aven, 2016).",uaeu.ac.ae,United Arab Emirates University,United Arab Emirates,24.19718435,55.680583440887546

The equipment performance depends primarily on the quality of maintenance execution. Therefore, dealing with breakdowns before occurrence aids the maintenance department in selecting appropriate strategies. The study explores different categories of maintenance strategi es to investigate the most basic causes of equipment or process disruption. This strategy includes conventional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The emphasis is on ensuring the good work ing condition of equipment to prevent breakdowns. The importance of Maintenance Performance Measurement metrics at the strategic level is discussed in detail.  The study further develops a research methodology to measure Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and plant availability.  The data collected are from the breakdowns and failure records for the equipment under consideration. Critical equipment such as pumps, compressors, vessels, reactors, strainers, heat exchangers, valves, and flow transmitters are isolated to determine which contributes the most to plant downtime. The data collection process starts by analyzing the data from historical records, which are customarily recorded into the Computerized Maintenance Managem ent System (CMMS) by the maintenance department. A statistical technique called Pareto is utilized to select a partial number of critical equipment to substantiate the adequate areas for continued development to minimize downtime and increase equipment availability. Some equipment experiences repetitive failures. The frequency of specific condition-based maintenance strategies and inspections is improved by increasing the amount of monitoring.

Introduction This case study identifies several pumps as ""critical bad actors"" and analyzes their failure modes to develop a Failure Modes, Effects Analysis to assist in informing proactive maintenance of pumps. Thus, critical infrastructure, such as gas production plants, is increasingly important to protect and ensure their dependability. An enhancement of mai ntenance productivity is influenced by the necessity to focus on minimizing equipment failures and costs acquired due to maintenance in the gas processing plant. Maintenance performance measurement in organizations is necessary to assist maintenance manage rs in addressing concerns about low equipment availability and increased maintenance cost. The intention is to improve equipment availability, reduce maintenance costs, and maximize the organization's profit. A complementary method to reduce the cost assoc iated with equipment failures requires high reliability to improve product quality and enhance equipment reliability. It has been established through research by Inyiama and Oke (2021) that plant and equipment downtime analysis is essential to its continua tion and constitutes above 50% of assets of significant maintenance operations. The failure and downtime of critical equipment would significantly reduce the financial benefit of the plant in terms of maintenance, production, and downtime costs.

The analysis is conducted with a comparison of two different countries, South Africa and the United States of America. The keywords are identified through an academic library search to gauge the order of importance and relevance.  A spreadsheet algorithm is created to hold data collected from the popular job market site. The data is collected and stored as two separate data sets for analysis. These keywords are fed into a spreadsheet algorithm with their corresponding country datasets. This process identifies a difference  between the keyword comparison of the two data sets. By identifying and highlighting the key skills required from project managers in the future within these job markets, we can focus on what project managers in the future need to improve, harness and utilise for success in their fields. Keywords Project manager, project management, skills, digital age, South Africa. Introduction A Project Manager (PM) has many responsibilities that coincide with their environment. This environment evolves, and in turn, their skills evolve as well. This change is driven by the digital age created as we move through the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The skills of a PM have typically been less technologically focused and more human - centred. An ideal project manager m ust balance hard and soft skills to adjust the project in society’s digitalised transformation (Ribeiro, Amaral & Barros, 2021).  The analysis is carried out to compare the importance of varying skills in the current job market in each country. This analysi s in this paper will be conducted with the comparison of two countries considered: South Africa and the United States of America (USA). The USA has one of the most prominent and leading job markets in the world currently (U.S. News, 2022). This allows a c omparison of skills to a well -established work market for the South African analysis to have valid and valuable points of comparison. The analysis is carried out to compare the importance of varying skills in the current job market in each country, as this will be important for future employers and employees. Human capital is considered important when driving success for companies. Organisations can overcome challenging circumstances and navigate the fast pace environment they exist in when skilled personne l are employed (Mitrović, Bjelica, & Borozan, 2023). The typical PM is required to adapt to the multi-disciplinary and cross-departmental nature that the job demands. First, the new or adapted skills must be identified in context before being applied. The objectives of the study are as follows: • Identify the relevant keywords to identify skills for project managers in the digital age. • Illustrate skill prominence and relation to project management. • Compare the keyword search from research to a real-world career website from two different countries to highlight changes and skill evolution. Theoretical Background Project management needs to align with the strategy and vision of an organisation.

Additionally, urbanization, population growth, climate change, and resource constraints negatively impact urban infrastructure, planning, and management. T his challenges water distribution and management. With the onset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, there is  need to understand the current status of the water distribution network (WDN), specifically digital maturity. This study aims to extract from literature, every element of a WDN, including systems and equipment, from sensors to enterprise resource planning (ERP). To comprehend the technologies and apparatus currently used to enhance water distribution management, the study uses a systematic literatu re review (SLR). The paper starts off with a literature review that filters relevant keywords, which are used to formulate a search string that is used in the SLR to retrieve data. The retrieved data is systematically reviewed using a two-tier qualitative analysis. First, bibliometric analysis is conducted, followed by critical content analysis. The bibliometric analysis emphasizes how closely connected WDN is to sensors, leak detection, and water quality. The 4IR systems and equipment are highlighted in the content analysis to help water utilities deal with problems like water quality and leaks. Keywords Digital water distribution network, Equipment, Industrial control systems, SLR, Water distribution network. Introduction There is a limited supply of cl ean drinking water. Rapid social development pollutes the environment, including surface and underground water reserves  (Babunski, Zaev, Tuneski & Bozovic, 2018).  In addition to rapid social development, urbanization, population growth, climate change, and resource constraints also negatively impact urban infrastructure, planning, and management (Feingold, 2018).  In crucial operations like the creation of thermal energy and agricultural processing, water is a crucial raw material. Water is also frequently used for domestic,  agricultural, and industrial purposes. Despite the fact that clean water is a scarce resource, 35% of clean water, worldwide, is lost every year in the Water Distribution Network (WDN) due to leaks, pipe bursts, and theft (Liemberger & Wyatt, 2019). These losses cause financial loss and harm to the environment.  One of the challenges that water utilities face is ensuring an uninterrupted supply o f chemically and biologically clean water through the WDN  (Babunski, Zaev, Tuneski & Bozovic, 2018). Thus, water utilities are struggling to maintain a reliable WDN. According to Liewiet (2019), a reliable drinking WDN is capable of providing and delivering water of acceptable quality to all consumers at all times. One of the most important aspects of WDN is reliability, which ensures public safety and allows industries, farming, urban and rural activities to run continuously. WDN's optimal reliability and maintenance benefit service recipients. Reliable and properly maintained WDN saves the water utilities money and improves customer satisfaction, quality of life, and service delivery. Moreover, this will extend the life of the WDN (Kiewiet, 2019). In addi tion to rapid social development, urbanization, population growth, climate change, and resource constraints also negatively impact urban infrastructure, planning, and management.  The key aspects of the systems management cycle (e.g., WDN) include architect ure, design, implementation, and management. The ability to integrate all systems is difficult, particularly in older plants. It is critical to be able to guide common upper -level systems based on lower-level integration (Kiewiet, 2019).

The ability to define a traditional business strategy is highly dependent on the current operational paradigms, but a digital business strategy must consider all sign ificant contributors from the technical architecture, change management, strategic role-out plan, skills migration plan together with advanced digital tools.   This research develops a digital business strategy based on a detailed landscaping process that i ncludes a full review of all functions of the business, global best practice and the company’s existing business strategy.  The first priority is to define and align the digital strategy with the business strategy.  Here the approach is to design for optim ization (transform), replication (for growth), and sustainability (new feedstock, empowerment).  The strategic digital roadmap developed herein focuses on the optimization of current processes via digital and other tools.  The roadmap includes the design of systems with replication as the core of the design.  The support systems and governance structures proposed include architecture, process management, service management, knowledge repository, and skills strategies (delivery through people and culture).  The digital road map defined includes total business visibility, delivering on multi -dimensional visibility, and workflows enabling optimization .  This research contributes to the body of knowledge by shedding light on the predicaments associated with devising and implementing digital business strategy.  The research subsequently devises a novel  approach to digitally transform organizations through digital business strategy that leverages various significant elements such as  traditional business strategies, processes, resources, advanced digital technologies, and industry best practices. Keywords Business Strategy, Digital Business Strategy, Digital Transformation, Digital Maturity. Introduction A business strategy is used by organizations as a set of mech anisms to define and describe methods to compete with and gain competitive advantage over competitors (Fischer et al., 2020). As suggested by Sishi and Telukdarie (2021), a successful business strategy should yield business growth, competitive advantage, a nd significant financial performance. Traditional business strategies are based on existing operational paradigms as opposed to digital business strategies which consider various significant aspects that are centric to digital technologies and tools, techn ical architectures, change management, skills migration, etcetera (Guo et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023 & Feliciano-Cesero et al., 2023). Digital business strategies employ digital technologies to integrate systems, products, processes, and services. A r esearch work (Ziyadin et al., 2020) define s these digital technologies as a spectrum of information, computing, communications, and connectivity technologies. Digital business strategies are aimed at ushering organizations into the digital world through a process called digital transformation (DT). Described by Chanias et al. (2019), DT is an all-encompassing business transformation underpinned by Information Systems (IS) that comprises basic economic and technological changes at organizational and industry levels. Konopik et al. (2022) claims that DT spans beyond digital technologies, but also impacts structures, employees, and organizational procedures. A  digital transformation strategy (DTS) has become pivotal for pre-digital organizations across traditional industries. However, the development and implementation of a DTS has remained an open subject (Chanias, 2019). This research developed a DTS based on the existing business functions, global best practices, and the company’s business strategy. The DTS is aimed at digitally transforming, growing,  and sustaining organizations.

Also, they make headlines for poor performance and face failure due to increased challenges arising out of technological advances and uncertainties. The objective of this research study is to identify ri sk factors in Mega Railway projects that can impact project performance. This paper proposes evaluating mega-projects using the NTCP (Novelty, Technology, Complexity, Pace) framework and then identifying risks in the projects as well as their interdependencies. An extensive literature review was performed initially, and a case-based approach is adopted for this paper. Interviews with experienced project professionals were conducted to gather information on the two mega railway doubling projects. Assessing t hese risk factors help in the effective planning and execution of the Railway mega-projects in India. Risk can be mitigated by maintaining risk registers to monitor risks dynamically. Keywords Mega-projects, railway projects, transportation, NTCP (novelty, technology, complexity, and pace), risk, case study Introduction Almost 1500 Mega Railway projects worth at least $ 2.1 trillion are planned globally in 2022 (UIC, 2022). The railway system is an efficient transport mode for long-distance to transport people, goods and for shorter journey as India is a populous country, expected to have the largest population by 2050 (projected to be 1652 millions) (Pati et al., 2015). Further, the continued increase in demand for freight and passenger rail service s will lead to more  railway network capacity. India has a varied terrain, and the type of infrastructure is different such as passenger trains, metro, monorail and upcoming bullet trains. In the next five years, Indian railway market will be the third largest, accounting for 10% of the global market (Tripathi & Chaturvedi, 2019). The government agencies seek to increase the speed and frequency of passenger trains operating on certain freight lines, further adding to the demand for new railway capacity and optimizing the utilization of the total track system. Consequently, many single-track routes will require additional tracks to accommodate traffic demand. Single track has a c onsiderably lower capacity than double track. These single -track sections are often bottlenecks that constrain overall line capacity. On double track mainlines, since one track can essentially be dedicated to a particular direction of traffic, capacity is improved (Sogin et al., 2016). The railway projects include new lines, gauge conversion, and multitracking (doubling/tripling), which have been tripled (Urban transport news, 2022). Track Doubling is where a new track is constructed in parallel with the existing track. Mega railway projects are inherently complex and uncertain  as many stakeholders are involved in the project. Different project management practices are needed for different projects due to different location-specific conditions, constraints, and challenges. It is critical to understand the unique risks involved in such projects. Risk identification in the early stages of the project helps to improve project performance. This would allow us to focus on crucial risk factors and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. This research study is aimed to classify the railway projects using the Novelty -Technology-Complexity-Pace ( NTCP) framework and analyze risks . A case -based approach is adopted for the study.

Their use helps close the gap between managers and their teams, creating efficient iterations of deliverables. This study seeks to expand on existing Agile metrics, producing a dashboard of five new data visualizations which collectively give managers a more thorough understanding of their project portfolio. The dashboard is built upon employee-inputted data using Jira software. The first metric of the dashboard is a Planned vs. Actually C ompleted graph of tasks within a project. This metric gives the manager an understanding of the overall status of a specific project. Next is a forecasting metric, which keys the manager in on the severity of work backlog for a project. The following two m etrics display performance by team using a simple velocity index and the importance of a team to a specific project using a weighted index. These two metrics are compiled for the fifth and final metric, which gives each team a score on their overall contri bution to a project. This dashboard can be used to determine which projects may need to be reprioritized along with which teams may need workload balancing or additional resources. Keywords Data Metrics, Agile Methods, Team Performance Introduction Management awareness has long been an improvement area for organizations that work to develop projects along a specified timeline. Finding the balance between micromanagement and a team’s intrinsic drive to perform is also a point of contention for program -level management. It is even more complex for managers to effectively track team performance across many different projects and project levels. Fortunately, new Agile methods and software ha ve been developed to help close the gap between teams and their manage r’s understanding of their performance (Dragicevic, 2019). However, these new engineering processes may not align well with traditional metrics, such as earned value. We sought to explore what new metrics can be developed to support Agile methods and impr ove management awareness. We use concepts from well -established Agile metrics to develop new ones that collectively inform a manager on the wholistic status of their project portfolio. There are two main topics discussed in this paper, whose respective driving questions were, what is the completion status of our project and what is forecasted? and, how do individual teams contribute to project performance? These questions were answered through the development of a five-metric dashboard that visualizes employee-inputted data.

However, there remains a significant lack of understanding of the underlying market dynamics. Other s tudies have explored the application of complex systems modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the cr yptocurrency market and its dynamics. This paper explores the use of System Dynamics (SD) modeling to gain insight into the market mechanisms of Bitcoin. The aim of this research is to holistically investigate the intricate relationships among various factors influencing the dynamics of the Bitcoin market.  The SD model was developed using AnyLogic. It breaks down the Bitcoin market into five interlinked subsystems: Demand, Supply, Infrastructure, Users, and Price. Sensitivity analysis was then c onducted on three key parameters: energy costs, market sentiment, and the regulatory atmosphere . The results showed the feasibility of using SD as a tool for modeling Bitcoin market and testing market behavior under different scenarios.  The study highlight s the importance of considering a wide range of factors in predicting cryptocurrency prices and the significance of capturing the nonlinear interrelationships among these factors . It contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the Bitcoin market and can serve as a decision support tool for investors, analysts, and financial engineers . Such a support tool helps financial engineering practitioners to navigate the intricate cryptocurrency market, ultimately contributing to more robust and su stainable engineering management strategies in the financial domain. Keywords System Dynamics, Complex Systems Modeling, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Introduction There is a growing interest in the cryptocurrency market due to the remarkable growth of Bitcoin and the introduction of various new cryptocurrencies. As of January 1, 2023, Bitcoin price has experienced a return of more than 100,000% in the past ten years. However, the cryptocurrency market is notorious for high volatility and numerous studie s have explored the use of mathematical and statistical models to understand and predict the behavior of cryptocurrencies. Despite the studies that have been done, there remains a significant lack of understanding of the underlying dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency market is complex and influenced by macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and regulation, among other factors. Additionally, herding and feedback trading behaviors drive price dynamics across cryptocurrencies (King & Koutmos, 2021). While cryptocurrencies have provided investors opportunity to partake in a financial market, enrich their portfolio diversification, and potentially grow their wealth (Elu & Williams, 2023; Guo, Härdle, & Tao, 2022), predicting price trends is still a very difficult task. Many studies have explored the use of mathematical and statistical models to understand and predict the behavior of cryptocurrencies. For instance, Katsiampa (2019) examined the volatility inherent in Bitcoin and Ethereum by employing the Bivariate Diagonal BEKK model. Cortese, Kolm, and Lindström (2023) also utilized the Sparse Jump Model, a statistical methodological approach, to identify key features that impact the returns of cryptocurrencies. Ha and Dai (2022) explored the use of different econometric techniques to understand how volatility propagates through the cryptocurrency market.

Police and citizens now distrust and fear each other because of the prevalence of instances of police brutality. Numerous inc idents of police brutality indicate that policing requires a radical redesign that takes human rights into account. There is a greater need for smart policing technology management research as a result of new , increasingly ubiquitous technologies. Robotics  and surveillance cameras are examples of smart policing. In several jurisdictions worldwide, currently robocops are on patrol and some can be armed , e.g., the recent approval for use in San Francisco. Given its perceived inherit technical objectivity, well managed smart technology has the potential to improve policing and ethical outcomes. With adequate technology management, smart policing can potentially alleviate law enforcement racial bias and abuse. This critically appraised topic study finds that the re are few studies that address this issue. The defund the police movement calls for the reallocation of funds toward community services and community policing. In 2021, there was also a call for the US Congress to approve the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This research revealed that there are few studies that tackle this problem. With this critically appraised topic literature review, we make seven (7) recommendations on how resources can be effectively spent toward efficient law enforcement that leads to long overdue police reform using smart policing robocops. Keywords smart policing, robocops, AI ethics, AI bias, privacy, surveillance, cybersecurity, risk management, technology management, law enforcement Introduction Smart policing includes t he use of drones, gunfire detection systems, body cameras, license plate readers, facial recognition, and robocops. Some detection systems alert police of gunfire and others use predictive policing artificially intelligent (AI) software that attempt to identify where crimes will most likely occur (Abril, 2022).  We conducted a comprehensive critical appraisal of managing Robocops in smart policing technically and ethically published in 2022. That study was motivated by the police murder of George Floyd whic h resulted in protests worldwide against police brutality. The study concluded that while smart policing is pursued for the benefit of its efficiencies, the ethical issues and related demands from citizens go unmet. Thus, although smart policing has its benefits, police should not ignore the impact of technology on society and the need for Smart Justice (Maliphol  & Hamilton, 2022).

Informing these resourcing decisions and planning efforts requires rigorous and repeatable analysis with a tailorable approach. Sufficiency analysis enables staff planners to identify right-sized force structure while estimating the risk to mission when fo rce structure is insufficient. Fundamentally, sufficiency analysis answers: Is there a sufficient force structure (supply) to meet a set of projected mission demands using tailored readiness business rules? Three main inputs are required for sufficiency an alysis, which include a plausible mission demand signal, force structure broken-down into unit of employment, and readiness business rules. This approach has been applied across Army calibrated force posture, Security Force Assistance Command, special operations commands, and other Joints elements. This presentation describes an objective, scalable, repeatable, and flexible sufficiency analysis, and optimization  approach for future studies of continually evolving  force structure priorities. Keywords Sufficiency Analysis, Force Structure, Resourcing, Optimization, Heuristics Introduction The Research and Analysis Center (TRAC) developed its current sufficiency approach in 2011, which matured under the Army Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization study (Pippin, et al., 2014). Army senior leaders tasked TRAC with answering: “How do we (the U.S. Army) transition from today’s force to the Army of 2020 and still accomplish all that the Army must do as part of the Joint force?” Sufficiency analysis, which was one of the one of the three identified lines of effort , focused on examining the ability of vario us force design and mix solutions to provide necessary capabilities to meet projected demands over extended timeframes.  In this regard, sufficiency analysis was used to inform both force management and force modernization decisions. TRAC’s sufficiency analysis methodology uses a greedy algorithm to adequately model Army operational tempo and readiness. A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving heuristic that identifies locally optimal solutions as part of a greater strategy (DeVore & Temlyvakov, 1996). In this implementation, the algorithm models commander and staff force employment decisions by assigning preferred available units, as determined by a set of the business rules, to the highest-priority demand at a specific time but with no knowledge of the future.  TRAC has continuously refined this methodology and supporting modeling and simulation (M&S) over the course numerous studies to enable distributed data collection and analysis.

However, it is essential to note that financial products and services are directly linked to personal finance decisions and economic equity concerning diversity and demographics. One way to integrate DEI is by exploring qualitative perspectives on life, vehicle, and medical insurance. Addition ally, engineering economy courses often cover saving for retirement. This paper extends this as career and retirement planning to explicitly include career length, period of retirement, and the average age at death considering gender and ethnicity.  The Nat ional Vital Statistics System provides data on mortality rates that reveal significant disparities in life expectancy at various ages. For instance, a male American Indian or Alaska Native at the age of 32 has an expected lifespan of only 67.2 years, while a female Asian can expect to live 19.3 years longer, reaching an average age of 86.5 years. These differences are critical and warrant attention, particularly for students who need to plan their finances for retirement with these statistics in mind.

The importance of including investing for retirement is commonly cited due to the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement systems. This paper shows the importance of explicitly incorporating mortality (age at death) in these calculations. It also shows the dramatic differences when demographic- based information is considered. It is crucial for students to understand how they compare to the ""average"" person, as these averages often form the basis for published financial advice and marketing materials on loans, insurance, investing for retirement, social security, stocks, bonds, and annuities. Our paper focuses on mid -career analysis of the planned length of working life and retirement (career and retirement planning) using Equation 1. This presentation of career and retirement planning represents two advances: (1) explicitly including age at death and (2) incorporating explicit goals for when to retire or how long to be retired. remaining career + retirement period = average age at death – current age    (1) The average ages at death are found in the m ortality data of the 2020 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database (Arias and Xu, 2022). This tracks information for five ethnic groups, each broken down into male, female, and total categories. Many people are of mixed ethnicity, and NVSS follows the official statement from the Office of Management and Budget . “The category which most closely reflects the individual's recogn ition in his community should be used for purposes of reporting on persons who are of mixed racial and/or ethnic origins” [ OMB, 1977]. Selecting the appropriate demographic group or interpolat ing between them is one of many personal factors that a student must consider in selecting an expected mortality age and the range to be evaluated . Data for any of the ethnic/gender groups may be a good match for expectations influenced by lifestyle, family history, education, income, etc.",ak.net,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Though Argentina has achieved nominal universal healthcare coverage, through its public healthcare system, full effective coverage has not been achieved. The system also has a parallel p rivate care system, adding further complexity to the system. Though seen as a regional model for healthcare access, Argentina’s healthcare outcomes lag globally. To address this gap, a study was designed to identify the primary physical and nonphysical barriers and enablers to healthcare access in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Multi -sited ethnographic interviews with patients and providers during the summer of 2022 were analyzed to identify common experiences across insurance types and geographical locations in the province. The barriers and enablers identified were evaluated for the prevalence of the barrier or enabler and the magnitude of the processes needed to change or sustain them. Th is paper focuses on the systemic methodologies implemented  during the creation of the interview tool  to identify unknown information and guide the problem -identification process. The methodology and findings are relevant to engineering managers because this dual use of anthropological and systemic principles provides insights into systems’ complexity. Keywords Healthcare system management, systems thinking, managing complexity, transdisciplinary approach Introduction Organizations increasingly face wicked problems that exhibit complexity at multiple levels, redu cing engineering managers’ abilities to correctly identify underlying issues, understand the interaction of complexities, and efficiently determine problem-resolution approaches . Healthcare access is a wicked problem for engineering managers in healthcare administration due to its implications for guiding capital and staffing investments, providing quality care, and guiding best approaches for primary and secondary levels of care. More broadly, identifying systemic barriers and enablers is a beneficial methodology for problem identification and diagnostics in order to provide efficient guidance for investments, quality care, and direct approaches for levels of care. As a wicked problem, h ealthcare access exhibits differing levels of complexity , where a single disciplinary approach will yield incomplete results. Thus, a  transdisciplinary perspective is beneficial to study its barrier s and enablers, which can emerge from a systems approach (Sillitto et al., 2019) . In order to develop an initial model of resolving wicked problems through a systems -guided, transdisciplinary approach, a case study was devised for the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina . It was selected  due to the researchers’ access and the prevalence of mixed public-private healthcare systems globally , increasing the range of healthcare systems the study could be applicable to. Although Argentina achieved nominal universal healthcare coverage  through its public system , full effective coverage has not been achieved  (Novick, 2017; Rubinstein et al., 2018).

These skills complement the technical engineering foundation in relevant areas of science and mathematics combined with a solid grounding in engineering analysis, design and practice. However, there are continuing challenges in regard to understanding the optimal approaches for integrating professional skills and knowledge development in engineering management programs and more broadly across engineering education. Therefore, this study conduct ed a bibliometric review on professional skills development in engineering education. The method is based on systematic searching of the extant literature, which identified 88 documents according to keyword retrieval over a 5 year period from 2018 to 2022. The documents are categorized in terms of publication metrics (such as publication year, subject area and country of origin) followed by bibliometric analysis to determine co -occurrence of keywords, co-occurrence of text, and co-authorship in terms of countries. The study includes content analysis of the 10 publications having the highest citation count.

In 2016 we became certified by the American Society of Engineering Management (ASEM).   Feedback from that certification process recommended that we pursue a more formal means of program completion that also satisfies the university requirement of an exit requirement, such as an examination or final defense.  At the 2017 Annual ASEM conference a model was presented that was based upon ASEM’s Certified Professional in Engineering Management examination along with the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.  At the 2020 confere nce an update was presented and some preliminary reactions from our graduates to the change.  After six years we have significant experience and information to provide more summary results on the impact of this approach.  It is anticipated that the information in this paper will  be of interest  to other graduate programs seeking to formalize their graduation requirements. Keywords Engineering management master’s degree; final examination; Certified Professional in Engineering Management examination. Introduction The University of Idaho (U of I) has offered a master’s degree in engineering management (EM) for over 30 years. This degree program is oriented towards working engineers  and does not require a thesis.  The College of Graduate Studies at the U of I has a non-thesis requirement, called an exit requirement, such as a project, paper, portfolio, recital, or examination, as determined by the program (COGS, 2023).  The full text of this requirement is provided below in Appendix A.  Sin ce the program  started students have had the option to complete a project or take an additional elective and an examination developed by one of our faculty to meet this exit requirement of the university.  In 2016 we became certified by the American Society of Engineering Management (ASEM), the fourth program to be certified by ASEM. Feedback from that initial certification process recommended we pursue a more formal means of program completion for students choosing the examination option as it was deemed to be too ad hoc to meet ASEM standards. In response to feedback from the ASEM certification process we decided to create a more formal process of examination for students choosing to complete their master ’s degree program. There were several problems with the examination process at the time.  The exam was to cover the breadth of courses in the student’s program.  Because each student completed different electives, each exam was unique and required substant ial work to ensure a breadth of topics and academic integrity. Likewise, the exams were time consuming to grade fairly.  It was difficult to provide a consistent experience for each student because of these problems, especially if there were several students finishing at the same time .  To this end, we changed the option and added an additional one-credit course called EM  596 Capstone Integration.  The use of this course facilitates administration of the process rather than trying to keep track of test results on an ad hoc basis and record the accomplishment on the student’s transcript. The requirement to earn a passing grade in EM 596 is that students must pass the Certified Professional in Engineering Management (CPEM) examination administered by the ASEM (CPEM, 2023). This change resolved the problems mentioned above and our assumption was that there would be additional benefits.  Namely, the students would not only obtain their master’s in engineering management but become a CPEM at the same time.",uidaho.edu,University of Idaho,United States,46.72379775,-117.02043898436474
24,HORIZONTAL COLLABORATION IN A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK,@tamu.edu,"Horizontal collaboration, supply chain resiliency, logistics quality,","Supply chain resiliency and strength have recently gained attention due to several external factors. A global shortage of shipping containers, social unrest, conflict , as well as the recent pandemic have stress tested many supply chains. These challenges present themselves after several decades of the application of lean principles to supply chains resulting in the reduction of excess capacity (waste). In addition to m any other effects, these disruptions exposed weaknesses in supply chain resiliency for many industries. As firms worked to recover after global shutdowns and the resulting backlogs throughout the supply chains, capacity constraints in transportation added complexity and time to the recovery efforts. The supply chains that  collectively comprise the North American Association of Utility Distributors (NAAUD) are some of many that experienced these complexities and resulting service concerns. This project studies possible solutions to improve the resiliency and performance of these supply chains by introducing horizontal and vertical collaboration measures intended to strengthen the supply chains. These measures are formed through several methods of data analysi s, both qualitative and quantitative, and a thorough review of prior research. The data sources include interviews both inside and outside the electrical supply distribution industry and surveys collected from the members of the NAAUD. This data is synchro nized and combined with best practices identified through numerous research consortia completed through the Thomas and Joan Read Center for Distribution Research and Education, an integral part of Texas A&M’s Department of Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution. Keywords Horizontal collaboration, supply chain resiliency, logistics quality, Introduction The North American Association of Utility Distributors (NAAUD) is an association of leading regional electric utility distributors that serve the electric utility industry with products and supply chain services. The association was formed in the mid to late 1980’s to share information and pool resources between the original five members. The NAAUD now comprises thirteen distributors and over thirty manufacturers all serving the electric utility vertical. Collectively, the distributor members of the NAAUD have over 230 locations across North America and carry over $440 million in inventory (North American Association of Utility Distributors. 2022). These distributors and their manufacturer partners rely on a vast distribution network that includes third party logistics (3PL) providers to meet the needs of their customers. The 3PL providers are experiencing strong demand with manufacturers recovering from supply chain disruptions and a tight labor market, especially concerning drivers (Schulz, 2022). This demand is demonstrated in the form of higher prices, as well as reduced availability. The transportation industry is not exp eriencing this demand problem due to the recent pandemic. The problems with capacity restraints and rising demand date back to 2014 as documented by several trade and academic publications (Comerford, 2015; Jindel, 2014). Prior to this, the industry had be en recovering from the 2008 recession with many carriers barely generating enough cash to continue to operate (Jindel, 2014). As demand continued to fluctuate, carriers generally chose to raise prices and improve their operating margins when able as oppose d to investing in capacity. The demand surge in late 2016 and early 2017 yielded very similar results. Carriers chose operating margin over capacity increases (Cassidy, 2017). The pandemic affected transportation in 2020 and had profound effects, but for our purposes here it is sufficient to note that there was not a significant capacity increase from the beginning of the pandemic until now, even though there was additional increase in demand. Currently a realignment of existing capacity is underway as oppo sed to an expansion (Cassidy, 2022b). Capacity remains a concern of many shippers (Berman, 2022). Even with a recent decrease in demand, capacity is decreasing as well and at a greater rate (Cassidy, 2022a).",tamu.edu,Texas A&M University - College Station,United States,30.6108618,-96.35206061388457
25,USE OF PURPOSEFUL HUMAN ACTIVITY SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT IN WORKSHOPS,@oregonstate.edu,"Human Activity Systems, Purposeful Human Activity Systems, Principles, KPI, Performance Metrics, Organizational","University engineering student workshops are human activity systems with high turnover rates, low -experience student employees, resource limitations, and strict safety requirements. As such, they tend to function like job shops without much structure and consistency.   In situations where these systems undergo growth, the system complexity often increases, and consistency is reduced even further. While traditional management methods and tools could be adopted, these are often overlooked as these tools do not provide engineers and technicians with a relatable perspective and present a steep learning curve to successfully address their challenges. This is because the complexity created by organizational growth, combined with high turnover rates, and low -experience student employees is difficult to manage with these methods. In such settings, a framework that provides a flexible struc ture is required to guide the change rather than fitting it into a predefined structure. In this paper, the use of a purposeful human activity systems framework is illustrated as a case study, with an application in the Innovations lab at Oregon State Univ ersity. The case study provides insights into how engineering managers can apply purposeful human activity system principles to redesign organizations. Keywords Human Activity Systems, Purposeful Human Activity Systems, Principles, KPI, Performance Metrics, Organizational Change, Change Management Introduction Organizations in the manufacturing sector face rapid changes in markets and customer preferences that outpace the capabilities of traditional manufacturing facilities.  To maintain their competitiveness within their specific business markets, they must identify and implement innovative strategies which allow them to accommodate these new technologies. Bahrami (1992, p. 33) suggests that this transformation has compelled organizations to shift from rigid, monolithic organizational structures that are tailored for routine processes and repetitive tasks, and instead, embrace more flexible and adaptable organizational models that can re adily adjust to novelty, innovation, and change. Examples of these include Kanter et al.’s (1992) ten commandments for executing change, Kotter’s (1996) eight-stage process for successful organizational transformation, Luecke’s (2003) seven steps, etc. However, literature shows a high failure rate in organizational transformation initiatives aimed at renewing an organization’s structure, direction, and capabilities (Balogun & Hailey 2004). Burnes (2004) & Rune (2005) attribute this high failure rate prim arily to the lack of comprehensive and valid framework s to guide the initiation, implementation, and management of organizational change  as implementations mostly focus on tools and methods while ignoring the organizational system. Job shops are one kind of such organization facing changes, and often encounter greater challenges during such transitions due to a lack of work structure and process consistency  throughout the organizational change and management of resulting new processes. To be successful at transitioning from rigid manufacturing processes to more flexible ones, it is not enough to only change the processes: it is necessary to also change the way in which the organization is structured to better support the new requirements. This requires an organizational change and, in such settings, frameworks for change that have a holistic approach are necessary rather than models with a prescriptive style.

Knowing when to grade in a course is not readily codified in the research and instructional material is limited pertaining to how much material should be covered.  So, what is a college instructor to do when considering when and what to grade during the semester?  The objective of this study is to compare two grading constructs to determine which one was more effective in assisting student understanding and mastery of course content.  A college entry level course in engineering economy was used to assess two different pedagogic al grading approaches to determine if one approach was more effective as demonstrated by overall all grade averages per graded event and overall course averages.  WPR averages did improve using the lower number of lessons between exams  and increasing problem  solving sessions; however, WPR averages were higher due to the removal of concept questions which were placed into quizzes.  The averages for the concept quizzes were very low and indicate that cadets are not reading the material.  Student feedback supported the new construct over the old structure. Keywords Grading Pedagogy, Lesson Objectives, Testing, Student Assessment Introduction Assessing student grade performance is an important aspect of identifying performance mastery of material taught during a semester.  College class grade assessment in this study is broken into the letter grades of A, B, C, D and F. These grades are based upon a corresponding numeric assessment on a 4.0 scale.  Not all colleges or universities follow this scale exactly; how ever, it is the predominate method of grading  (NAEP, 2011).  Grading at a collegiate level can be varied and different based on institutions, instructors and courses.  Assessing a student’s mastery level of subject material normally is a summative assessment which includes graded exercises (tests, quizzes, etc) or through informal methods such as class recitation and observation .  The intent of these activities is to ass ess the student’s performance; however, when do you assess is a difficult question.  How many lessons and/or lesson objectives should one cover before one assesses a student’s mastery of the subject matter.  This paper provides a case study in a pedagogical approach that attempts to answer this question.  The objective of this study is to compare two grading constructs to determine which one was more effective in assisting student understanding and mastery of course content.  This paper will cover a background and literature review that reviews grading structures and exam frequency. The methodology section addresses the approach to assessing the pedagogical technique, followed by analysis, results and conclusions.  This is a pilot study, so detailed statistical analysis is not warranted, and descriptive statistics are used to make inferences for possible future research. This pilot study was executed over the spring term of AY23 from January-May 2023. Background Assessing college students’ abilities has a n interesting history in the US.  Grading is a method by which we assess student learning.  Yale was the first college to assign grades to students in 1785 (Durm, 1993).  However, this marking consisted of various adjectives and not the alpha- numeric construct we are accustomed to.  Likewise, other universities like William and Mary College followed Yale’s descriptive assessment methodology but tailor ed it to their own construct.  Under the leadership of Ezra Stiles, Yale produced the first record of using a marking system on a scale of 4; however, there was not a connection to the letter grades we use today  and was later changed to 9.0 (Durm, 1993).",westpoint.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Systems Statistical Engineering research seeks to integrate causal Bayesian hierarchical modeling (Pearl, 2009) and c ybernetic control theory within Beer's Viable System Model (S Beer, 1972; Stafford Beer, 1979, 1985) and the Complex Systems Governance framework (Keating, 2014; Keating & Katina, 2015, 2016) to produce multivariate systemic models for robust dynamic syste ms mission performance. (Cotter & Quigley, 2018) set forth the Bayesian systemic hierarchical constraint propagation theoretical basis for modeling the amplification and attenuation effects of environmental constraints propagated into systemic variability and variety. In their theoretical development, they simplified the analysis to only deterministic constraints, which models only the effect of statistical risks of failure. Imprecision and uncertainty in the assessment of environmental constraints will ind uce additional variance components in systemic variability and variety. To make causal Bayesian hierarchical modeling more capable of capturing and representing the imprecise and uncertain nature of environments, we must incorporate rough or fuzzy function s and boundaries to model imprecision and grey boundaries to model uncertainty in constraint propagation at each system level to measure the overall impact on the organization variability and variety.  This paper sets forth a proposed research method to in corporate rough, fuzzy, and Grey set theories into Systems Statistical Engineering causal Bayesian hierarchical constraints modeling. Keywords Fuzzy Hierarchical Systems, Causal Bayesian Hierarchical Models, Systems Statistical Engineering. Introduction Many of the world's most challenging statistical problems are large, complex, and unstructured. Statistical engineering has been proposed to guide the integration of multiple statistical methods to address these large, complex, and unstructured problems (Hoerl & Snee, 2010) . Statistical engineering was initially defined as: ""The study of how to best use statistical concepts, methods, and integrate them with information technology and other relevant disciplines, to achieve enhanced results. "" (Hoerl & Snee, 2 010). It involves the integration of statistical thinking (often at the strategic level) with the application of statistical methods and tools (at the operational level). It has the potential to provide the missing tactical link that will drive the proper application of statistical methods based on a solid understanding of statistical thinking principles. Statistical Engineering typically involves the appropriate selection and use of multiple statistical tools integrated with other relevant tools into a comprehensive approach to solving complex problems. In literature, (Cotter, 2012)  summarized previous studies that led to the proposal for statistical engineering, identified the gaps in knowledge that statistical engineering needs to address, explored additional gaps in knowledge not addressed in the prior works, and proposed a working definition of and body of knowledge for statistical engineering. In this paper, the author mentioned that rapid development in statistics and quality management cause failure to contribute to both academic and industrial domains. Quality experts do not seem to be using the latest published research, and scientists do not sufficiently inscribe the potential problems experienced by practitioners.

Currently, the Engineering Management Program (EMP) at the University of Colorado Boulder hosts a robust graduate program (Master of Engineering and several graduate certificates) but only a minor (Engineering Entrepreneurship or Engineering Management) option for undergraduates to serve students' needs for engineering management. A study has yet to be conducted to determine whether the curriculum prepared graduates for careers in engineering management in technical organizations. This study aimed to determine the skills and knowledge needed by graduates of the  University of Colorado Boulder ’s engineering management undergraduate program for successful professional careers in fields related to engineering management. The University of Colorado Boulder’s  current strategy is to assess students and  the needs of  their employers, and engineering managers, before expanding offerings for undergraduate students. By fully understanding the needs through the lens of current students, alums, faculty, advisors, and  engineering management recruiters, the EMP program can be reassessed to develop innovative programs and transform the curriculum into a program that will not only support the students throughout their careers but also create better employees for engineering managers. Keywords Engineering management, student perception, industry demand, higher education Introduction Engineers are hired for their technical skills but must have leadership and management skills to succeed. This program evaluation of the undergraduate EMP at  the University of Colorado Boulder aims to understand the extent to which current programming and proposed expansions to programming meet the needs of students and industry in terms of the skills they gain.

30,DESIGNING ENDURING PURPOSEFUL HUMAN ACTIVITY SYSTEMS: EMPLOYEE RECEPTION TO SYSTEMIC ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN,@oregonstate.edu,"Change Initiatives, Purposeful Human Activity System, Organizational Design","When designing and implementing organizational change, organizations’ successes depend heavily on their ability to implement change initiatives at all employee levels  holistically. This ability is further complicated by the fourth industrial revolution fostering trends that emphasize the need for increased productivity, implementation of new technologies, improved organizational agility, and minimizing resource utilization , as this increases the pressure for change initiatives to be more efficient and effective with little m argin for error.  While current research examines individual characteristics of change initiatives and change actors, and proposed implementation methods holistically examine the change implementation process, there remains a need to examine the barriers to employee acceptance of change initiatives holistically. These barriers to employee acceptance can compromise the overall adoption of change initiatives and increase the risk of overall failure.  In this research, the authors examine and illustrate employee -level barriers to change through a case study with the Division of Finance and Administration at Oregon State University , in which the university is creating a culture of adaptiveness and transparent decision -making. The authors posit that, by providing the foundations of best practices and known pitfalls, this research will assist engineering managers in developing and implementing successful, enduring organizational purposeful human activity systems. Keywords Change Initiatives, Purposeful Human Activity System, Organizational Design Introduction One of the most important factors in an organization’s success is its ability to adapt to a rapidly  changing, “high velocity” environment (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988) , and improving an organization’s aptitude for change continues to garner attention in engineering management fields  (McCarthy et al., 2010) . With a greater focus on adaptability in contemporary business environments, coupled with the proliferation of information and technological advances, organizational change initiatives are paramount to any organization’s long-term success, as the ability of an organization to adapt to changing circumstances has become a critical determinant of its survival and success (Porras & Silvers, 1991). Organizational change is best characterized as transforming an organization from its current state to its future state , focusing  particularly on large -scale operational and strategic changes (Jacobsen et al., 2019) . Organizational change initiatives aim to improve the organization’s effectiveness, efficiency, and overall performance through reaching a desired future state , and understanding the drivers , challenges, and success factors has become a key area of interest across many fields. Change management is integral to the implementation of significant changes, which refers to the deliberate and structured approach taken by organizations to facilitate the process of organizational change and reduce the risks and costs associated with the change initiatives while maximizing their benefits (Murthy, 2007). Effective change management is critical to the success of a change initiative. It may involve identifying and addressing resistance, building organizational support for change, and clearly and compellingly communicating the change’s purpose. The success or failure of a change initiative results from a combination of internal and external factors to the organization. A lack of acceptance and commitment to a change initiative by those who will be impacted by it can be detrimental to the initiative and can lead to resistance, conflict, and lack of cooperation   (Herold et al., 2007) . Additionally, ambiguity in the goals and objectives of the change can make developing strategies for its implementation and evaluation more challenging  (Burnes & Jackson, 2011) .

31,"ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE METRICS FOR AIRPORT WATER SUSTAINABILITY",@purdue.edu,"Sustainability, airport, management, ESG, water","As the world transitions from a shareholder to a stakeholder economy, engineering managers at airports are becoming actively engaged in sustainable deve lopment that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) consequences into management. Unlike previous sustainability frameworks that focused on reporting in a single direction, the ESG framework encourages a standard approach to assessing non-financial performance so that stakeholders can evaluate and compare ESG across organizations. While there are several publications on sustainability, no single definition and metrics have been agreed upon due to its subjective nature and customization to the individual entity. Although the focus o n sustainability may vary by industry, the water issue has received relatively little attention, particularly in the air transport sector. By examining airport sustainability reports, this article investigates airports’ water sustainability. The airports included in the analysis are those that are part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, participate in the Airport Sustainability Planning program, and have sustainability reporting documentation. Of the 30 large hub airports in the U .S., 12 airports participated in the Airport Sustainability Planning program, and of that, the researchers located sustainability, ESG or integrated annual reports for 8 airports. The findings have significance for offering a comprehensive definition of water sustainability , examination of goals, and suggested metrics that are applicable to other airports. As hub airports are similar to municipalities and have large physical plants with numerous engineering projects per year, these findings may be useful to engineering managers incorporating environmental sustainability in other large facilities. Keywords Sustainability, airport, management, ESG, water Introduction Climate change and natural resource depletion have been long-standing issues, but recent events such as the COVID- 19 pandemic, material shortages, and extreme weather patterns have highlighted the severity of their impact on human life. Anthropogenic actions are widely viewed as the cause of these problems and have garnered significant public attention (Mohommad & Pugacheva, 2022). In addition, the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) acknowledges  that taking responsibility for long -term sustainability in business and even government entities is a key to success (Boffo & Patalano, 2020).  ASEM emphasizes sustainability in the strategic planning and management domain and highlights the need of establishing metrics that enable assessing progress and adjusting the organization’s performance and behavior upon evaluation (EMBoK, 2019). The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework has gained prominence as a sustainable development strategy. It evaluates business performance and its impact by incorporating environmental, social, and governance aspects of data, along with financial value. Consequently, this underscores the need for uniform criteria in assessing and comparing ESG factors, as investors and stakeholders rely on such data to gauge business performance (Li, Wang, Sueyoshi, & Wang, 2021). Sustainability reporting tracks progress, benchmarks performance, and communicates with stakeholders to uphold an organization's reputation (Kolk, 2014). Materiality evaluation in sustainability reporting is conducted through stakeholder engagement. This process highlights the impacts an organization deems significant, and it determines the quality of the reporting (Torelli, Balluchi, & Furlotti, 2020). Examining airport sustainability reporting is meaningful, as it allows for the discovery of the industry's focus areas and the exploration of public sector practices that lag behind the sustainability reporting mainstream (Stefanescu, 2021).",purdue.edu,Purdue University,United States,40.430028,-86.92642114650494
32,A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND BEHAVIOR,@oregonstate.edu,"Purposeful human activity system, communication system, operational principles, organizational culture, management","Maintaining consistency between organizational culture and behavior is always a challenge, but this becomes critical in organizations that increase complexity over time. This is because the underlying organizational structures are not designed to handle changes in complexity. To navigate this challenge, operational principles can be used to provide guidance in what judgements and actions are advised when facing specific challenges due to an increase in complexity. However, without effective communication, the efficacy of the operational principles may be jeopardized . In this paper, the authors propose a conceptual framework to model different communication scenarios to better understand a human communication system, providing more conceptual clarity in how a human communication system behaves. The conceptual framework , thus,  can guide engineering managers  to better understand  how their organization communicates and improve the convergence of information. Hence, engineering managers can, by utilizing the conceptual framework, mitigate the challenge of maintaining consistency between organizational culture and behavior while experiencing changes in complexity in their organizations. Keywords Purposeful human activity system, communication system, operational principles, organizational culture, management of complexity Introduction The performance of a purposeful human activity system  (PHAS) is dependent on the relationship between ideas and happenings, meaning, an unsuccessful organization is one that does not balance thinking with action taking. Therefore, it is critical for the success of an organization to manage the relationship between its culture and behavior. Managing this relationship is difficult for any organization, however, it becomes especially difficult for organizations that exhibit higher levels of complexity (Jackson, 2003), and an imbalanced relationship between culture and behavior results in incommensurability with the organization’s purpose. Principles are rules that can guide purposeful judgement making and/or action taking within a context,  meaning the consideration of  the stakeholders’ situational interpretations and linguistic proficiencies within a specific situation (Calvo-Amodio & Rousseau, 2019). Hence, principles can be used to assist in managing this relationship regardless of the level of complexity present  (Rousseau, Brook, & Pennotti, 2022). Operational principles reflect an organization’s culture and or behaviors within a context. Therefore, having clearly defined operational principles can effectively guide an organization to appropriately manage the relationship between its culture and behavior. However, even with clearly defined operational principles, the relationship between organizational culture and behavior may not be m anaged if the organization does not effectively communicate (Kittelman, Calvo-Amodio, & Martínez León, 2018). An effective communication system facilitates the conveyance and convergence of information within an organization. T hough the conveyance of information and the convergence of information are typically defined as separate processes, the efficacy of convergence is dependent on how information is conveyed. Hence, by defining communication as a system, it is possible to des ign effective communication systems that facilitate  the utilization of operational principles, thus, managing the relationship between organizational behavior and culture. From the research of Kittelman, Calvo-Amodio, & Martínez León (2018), a communication system is defined as a conceptual system emerging from the interplay of two subsystems: information conveyance and information convergence.

The Office is charged with protecting human health and the environment at 101 sites in over 30 states and territories, from Puerto Rico to Alaska. The Office is the steward o f the legacy sites post -remediation that played a critical role in America’s nuclear history. As such, its commitment to long-term stewardship is at the center of everything it does, beginning the moment the Office takes over a legacy site and continuing throughout long-term management efforts. This paper reviews the long-term stewardship best practices undertaken by engineering managers in the Office. It describes the necessary components of an effective science and engineering program, specifically the protection of human health and the environment, beneficial reuse, monitoring remedial activities, stakeholder engagement, and international collaboration. Additionally, the p aper explores engagements with local communities, state and local governments, and tribal nations across numerous mediums to educate and inform the public of ongoing stewardship activities. It will emphasize the importance and commitment required of long-term stewardship.

Its scope has grow n from 30 in 2003 to 101 sites today, and the number will continue to grow. Ultimately, this paper may be useful to engineering managers seeking the best practices for the long-term care of legacy sites post-remediation. Keywords Best practice, beneficial reuse, engineering manager, long-term care, long-term management, long-term stewardship, post-remediation, stakeholder engagement, and protection of human health and the environment Introduction The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Legacy Management (hereinafter Office) shapes the future of legacy sites through their commitment to science, engineering, and long-term stewardship. The Office ensures the physical controls, institutional controls, and other mechanisms needed to ensure the protection of the surrounding communities and the environment at the sites. Cleanup has been completed and an adequate and durable remedy is in place for each site. The objective of this paper is to describe the best practices engineering managers use in the conduct of long-term care at these sites. Since the establishment of the Office, the authors learned that it takes continuous learning and a lot of people working together and talking to each other for long -term stewardship activities to be fully successful and effectively implemented. It is certainly not a one-person job. All-important collaboration and consultation with stakeholders, and teamwork is key to effective long-term stewardship. The American Society for E ngineering Management underscores the importance of engineering managers applying best practices and lessons learned to current practices (Shah & Nowocin, 2019). This paper explores the best practices found to be useful by engineering managers carrying out their stewardship responsibilities.

The scope of this design focuses on comprehensive analytical techniques that present a straightforward detail-orientated inventory management system. An Inventory Management System provides a framework of mechanisms focused on itemization while assisting management teams in regulating their organization's reserves. This venture was organized to manage the inventory at  the Bio MC  Corporation, a worldwide leader in the biomedical engineering industry,  albeit these principles can be applied to any organization. The methodologies that surround this system are focused on inventory analysis, the capability of preserving attainable amounts of inventory, the implementation of an algorithm to assist with component reorder ing, and a technique for analyzing statistical data and trends. This inventory system aims to solve known issues affecting inventory levels and machine downtimes. This system was constructed to establish a categorical scheme for the maintenance engineering department for a business that was created on the beliefs of on-time completion and customer satisfaction. Without an accurate level of inventory, a corporation such as Bio MC  could risk the likelihood of extensive downtimes and unnecessary expenditures a ffiliated with resolving its inventory deficiencies. A reliable inventory management system, such as the one created, will alert organizations such as Bio MC  when it is time to reorder components affiliated with their maintenance engineering department and  can assist in diminishing unnecessary downtimes and costs. Keywords Implementation, comprehensive, algorithm, statistical, expenditures, deficiencies, diminishing Introduction After comprehensive research, it was discovered that m ost modern-day inventory management systems available in today’s market rely on employees recording and tracking data on generic web-based applications. These utilities are designed by means of a universal template with generalized functions and commands  and do not accommodate the client’s needs. These deficiencies contribute to wasteful time and inefficient inventory management. With this data, it became glaring that a custom inventory management system had to be created that encompassed the Bio MC Corporations inventory demands while adapting to this organization’s exponential rate of growth and development. This system is a unique technique for an ease-of-use, user-generated inventory management system. As Oracle's senior director Lisa Schwarz described , ""Inventory control, also called stock control, is  the process of ensuring the right amount of supply is available in an organization.

The tools used during this research analyze the technology's performance in methods that increase the energy efficiency of a building. This document compares buildings that implemented automation technology for energy and those that have not installed technology for energy efficiency.

Introduction Energy efficiency is a growing concern. Engineers and architects continuously work together to combat the global climate change crisis while improving the quality of construction projects for residential and commercial use. The development of innovative technology has made it easier for end users and contractors to detect unnecessary energy usage. Most of the technology researched during this experiment  measured energy usage. According to Turnbull (2003), “If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.” Measurement and verification are the most critical processes in energy efficiency. M&V allow the end users to know how much energy is getting used. Technology such as fluid gas analyzers, piezoelectric light meters, blower doors, turbine flow meters, and duct blaster doors are standard tools used in this research to measure and verify energy usage. Implementing these tools and other tools in the energy sectors of gas, HVAC, lighting, and water systems requires a concentrated effort to improve energy efficiency. According to the Statistica’s (2018) report on total energy consumption in the United States, the industrial and residential sectors account for the least amount of energy usage compared to the transportation and commercial sectors. However, residential and industrial end users are more likely to implement energy-efficient technologies and practices to decrease their energy use. Theoretically, automation technology in building efficiency is a significant factor contributing to the variance in each sector to improve energy usage. Although technology helps detect unnecessary energy use, it will take more effort than just installing digital and analog devices to eliminate energy waste.

The best product quality is the final goal for any manufacture. However, outstanding quality  requires systematic efforts through each entity during the production lifecycle. The company A is a global medical device company based in America. This study case describes some quality problems of a mobile based medical software application that works with an implantable device. Since  the initial release was launched at 2015, there were four releases being launched to the market via the submission and approval from  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until 2022. Thousands of patients are actively using this therapy product. Based on the statistical data, the company received some critical (not fatal) issues which were reported by the users include clinicians and patients. The issues are filed as Field Corrective Actions (FCA) per the regulatory requirement. FCA is the action to remove or correct the product risk to user’s health and any violation for any distributed product in the market. FCA usually reflects the technical weakness and risks of  product quality management and control process. Remarkably, the testing phase is the capstone for product quality  because any application defect is supposed to be captured by testing. Therefore, this study case focuses on the testing phase and discusses about applying the DMAIC model to improve product quality by analyzing and improving the testing effectiveness and efficiency. Keywords Software Application, Field Corrective Actions, Medical Device, Testing, Product Quality Introduction Quality has been typically regarded as a key strategic component of competitive advantage, and therefore, improving product quality has been a matter of prime concern for firms ( Flynn et al., 1995; George Foster and Leif Sjoblom, 1996; Euphemia Yuen and Sian Chan, 2010). Medical software product is not like other regular software products which are used in everyone’s daily activities. It is highly specified for the disease treatment, and it must be regulated by the agencies such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A medical product should hav e the best quality and minimized risk for patient safety. However, the software application defect is almost not avoidable due to the nature of the software product. Therefore, the goal of the medical company is always about how to improve the quality and reduce the risk (Banik et al., 2022). The product quality usually associates with reliability, functionality, customer satisfaction, and safety. These four aspects are proved to be managed well by the quality management process and practice per some theories. What is Six Sigma? Six Sigma is a modern tool that usually used to help the entertainment control the quality from product reliability, customer satisfaction, user safety and product functionality these four different divisions.

Furthermore, it will detail the benefits towards a well-produced PMP and how it must be required for one to be developed at every DoD installation. Keywords Pavement Management Plan (PMP), Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), Pavement Condition Index (PCI) report, Airfield Pavement Evaluation (APE) report, Transportation Management Plan (TMP) Introduction The Department of Defense’s largest installation is Joint Base San Antonio based off the number of mission partners and employees working at the installation. The base is spread across 11 geographically separated areas that combined during the most recent Base Realignment and Closure policy in 2005. It took the three main bases (Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, and Fort Sam-Houston) and placed them under a single installation commander. The intent was to drastically reduce the cost of opera tions of the separate installations by combining their resources and eliminating any overages. While the policy did eliminate some costs, it also vastly increased the scale of certain areas. One of these areas w as the Transportation Networks and Airfield P avements (TNAP). Instead of managing two or three geographically separated areas (GSAs), Air Force Civil Engineers were responsible for managing eleven. Each GSA is basically the equivalent to a small town; they each have their own stores, work areas, roads, parking lots, and possibly airfields. While it was possible to manage the TNAP for one installation, adding on two additional major installations made the old management of TNAP unfeasible. It is simply  too much to handle if all the separate inputs had to be just that: separate. The development of a Pavement Management Plan seeks to combine these sources into a single document for ease of access and increased simplicity. Additionally, a PMP seeks to prevent costly and time - consuming failures in pavement. Due to the nature of these three, main installations, failure is not an option. Lackland Air Force Base trains all new Airmen for the entirety of the Air Force through Basic Military Training (BMT).  Approximately 55,000 new Airmen come through Basic Training every year. BMT directly feeds initial training schools and these Airmen, upon graduate of these training schools, go on to staff every unit in the Air Force.

The impact of this shift is often overlooked as profits and well performing organizations are rewarded through increasin g stocks. For instance, the cost  of poor quality (COPQ) highlights organizational responsibility of scrap, wastes, rework or recalls. Medical device recalls, an unfortunate occurrence, can be strong indicators of poor performance of design and manufacturing approache s. This paper will explore three aspects surrounding CMs and OEMs  specific to SFMDs: (1) An analysis between two prominent medical device manufacturers Boston Scientific and Medtronic via a summary of FDA recalls in the last year for each mapped against financial statement information  on NYSE, (2) SWOT analysis of CMs vs OEMs and (3) explore the core supplier team via a RACI diagram. A large organization with a strong quality system may struggle to implement proper controls to external suppliers especially in a consistent manner. The success of the integration of this outsourcing strategy is to develop strong long-lasting relationships.

For instance, from 1995 to 2002 the use of CMs in the electronics industry grew 43% (Gray, et al., 2009). They provide flexibility for organizations to grow by leveraging the capability they bring to facilities that have reached capacity .

The gathered data will be used to determine the most efficient method to optimize the maintenance intervals of the aircraft in order to minimize these particular malfunctions. There have been numerous incidents where a malfunction within the pressure systems or sealing components have caused an aircraft to undergo cabin decompression. These particular scenarios may have been prevented with the prope r maintenance protocol in place. Preexisting studies indicate that the incorporation of optimized maintenance intervals assist airlines in maintaining aircraft reliability in all aspects. The analysis will draw particular attention to the pressurization system malfunctions of the Boeing 737 aircraf t through a means of probability and probability distributions, as well as confidence intervals for single and multiple sample groups. The results of the analysis will indicate that with an optimized maintenance s chedule, the percentage of specified malfunctions are significantly lower than previously recorded statistics. The cost effectiveness will subsequently benefit from this concept as well as the quality control aspect of prematurely detecting an issue within the components of the aircraft. Preventative maintenance will not only increase the lifespan but will assists airlines in managing operations that are safe for the environment, reliable for passengers, while also being economically efficient.

Introduction Cabin decompression within an aircraft is a concept in which the plane cabin undergoes a process of depressurization. Individuals generally experience significant discomfort at altitudes over 3000 meters; therefore, the cabin of the aircraft is typically kept at a pressur e that corresponds to an altitude of 2500 meters  (Smejkal, 2016). To keep the cabin at this pressure, a controls system is utilized to maintain a constant supply of pressurized air throughout the fuselage of the aircraft  (Brady, 1999). With the incorporati on of a regulated and extensive maintenance schedule, pressurization system malfunctions are consequently minimized. The pressurization control system design of the Boeing 737 consists of multiple components to complete the assembly. These particular components consist of valves, digital pressurization control systems, and wiring assemblies. A specific incident that involved a pressurization system failure of a Boeing 737 aircraft was on Helios Flight 522. After an initial incident investigation was conducted by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board, also referred to as the AAIB. The cause of the crash was determined to be from a malfunction of the pressurization control system. During this particular malfunction, the cabin underwent a rapid phase of decompression. The primary cause of this misfortune was the unsafe wiring design for one of the major pressurization control system components (AAIB, 2016), which is located within the loom of the fuselage. The loom is a specified area within the electronic and equipment bay that houses the major wiring components of the cabin pressurization control system (Williams, 2020). The statistical analysis will be conducted with the percentage o f major aircraft crashes  in relation to how many were caused by prior damages of the pressurization system that may have been overlooked during a routine maintenance inspection  (Elakramine et al., 2021; Kerr et al., 2020 ; Hossain et al., 2022 ).

42,EFFICACY OF AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT WITH RED LIGHT CAMERAS IN PREVENTING AUTOMOBILE COLLISIONS,@astate.edu,"Engineering Management, Automated Enforcement, Red Light Camera, Public Safety, Accident Prevention","This paper explores the efficacy of automated enforcement with red light ordinances in preventing automobile collisions in Suffolk County, NY and how it relates to engineering management. The automated enforcement or red - light camera study, as it is referred to, evaluates intersections with these red-light cameras and monitors the accidents over three separate periods, the pre -enforcement period (2007 to 2009), and the active enforcement period (2010 to 2013). The study also explores the post -enforcement period, after the removal of some cameras (2015 to 2017). The severity of crashes is categorized as follows: Fatal, Injury, Fatal and Injury, or Property Damage only. The study was commissioned by the county to an independent engineering consulting firm following major backlash from the county residents, citing separate studies, upon the installation of these red-light cameras. The cameras fine violators eighty dollars for every violation caught on these cameras. Although the study concludes that more crashes occur in the active enforcement period with cameras, it also shows conclusive evidence that less fatal accidents occur compared to pre - enforcement periods. Keywords Engineering Management, Automated Enforcement, Red Light Camera, Public Safety, Accident Prevention Introduction The use of automated enforcement devices has become commonplace in modern traffic engineering, specifically in larger cities and suburbs surrounding them  (Hossain et  al., 2022) . The two major examples of these automated enforcement devices are speed limit monitors and red -light cameras. This paper will focus on the red -light camera, specifically those installed in the suburbs around New York City, in Suffolk County. These cameras are installed at intersections to monitor the vehicle movement through red lights, subsequently snapping a picture of the license plate and a video of the violation. The citations for these violations are sent to the registered owner of the vehicle. Suffolk County began the installation of these cameras in 2009, commissioning the Red Light Camera (RLC) program. Fifty (50) locations were installed and turned on by June 2010, followed by another fifty (50) locations being authorized and installed by the end 2014. During this period of installation, eighteen (18) of the first fifty (50) installed cameras were relocated to different intersections. To date, the RLC Program is operating at these 100 locations with 215 cameras total. The purpose of the RLC program is to reduce red light running and collisions related to driving through the red lights. For example, a common accident seen at busy intersections which may result is fatal injuries are right angle / left turn crashes. The program installed these cameras with the safety of drivers in mind, specifically those in situations where a right angle or left turn is likely to occur.  The county has utilized traditional police enforcement of red light running in the past, however, this is not seen as an effective safety measure given the limited number of police officers and law enforcement resources to cover the extensive network of signalized intersections. Suffolk County decided to initiate their own study on the efficacy of automated enforcement devices due to the many conflicting studies that have been done in the past. The anticipated results of the study align with the study conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) which evaluated an RLC program in California with 132 intersections. The data collected suggests that these cameras will increase the total number of crashes, but reduce fatal",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513

Six Sigma methodologies such as DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement and Control) will be used to gather data to make necessary improvements. Electronic Engineering Changes (ECN) accounts for 53% of the manufacturing rework and scrap cost. The aim is to use six sigma methodology to identify and improve engineering’s role in quality improvement. In order to improve this manufacturing process, the drawings and designs must be compared to production and assembly to ensure that fabrication and welding is done correctly. Continuous improvement and the engineering department are tasked with reducing the total number of electronic engineering changes weekly. This study will identify engineering’s role in process inefficiency and implement six sigma methodology to reduce scrap and rework cost. Keywords Engineering Change Notice, Standards, DMAIC, Six Sigma Introduction With the increasing cost of materials and continuous logistics problems due to covid-19, manufacturing companies are tasked with finding creative ways to increase profitability. Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus, officially known as SARS- CoV-2 virus (World Health Organization, 2020). In order to improve manufacturing processes, companies must be able define where improvements are needed. There are 5 steps in the lean six sigma process that include Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control: otherwise known as the DMAIC process (George et al., 2005). Successful implementation of the DMAIC methodology helps manufactures overcome obstacles while operating more efficiently. “The integration of lean and Six Sigma aims to target every type of opportunity for improvement within an organization” (Pepper & Spedding, 2010) The ability to define the problem is the first step in improvement. The DMAIC process takes an organized and systematic method for strategic process improvement, product, and service development that relies on statistical methods and the scientific method to make dramatic reduction in customer defined defect rate (Antony, et al., 2008). Management must seek out opportunity for process improvement and define project goals while meeting customer expectations. Lean six sigma is a systematic methodology used to eliminate waste, streamline production processes, and reduce costs within an organization (Strong, 2018). This study involves a small local manufacturing company that wishes to improve its production process. The company continues to grow reaching production and budget goals each quarter. Consequently, as the company continues to grow so does production demands. Several adjustments have been made to withstand the effects of covid and remain profitable. While doing so this highlighted several inefficiencies and variations within the manufacturing production process. The area of concentration will be engineering’s role in process improvements. With the fast past nature of manufacturing and the constant changes in vendors, regulations and customer needs engineering’s help in improvement is essential to future success. The goal is to reduce the amount of errors caused from engineering. This may seem difficult task, but with implementation of the DMAIC methodology one can use a data driven strategy for process improvement.

As social media is a place for networking, it can accommodate large numbers of social networks. On the other hand, graph theory has long been considered an excellent tool for extracting the necessary  information from social networks. This study applies graph theory on social media networks  of airlines  to determine their market expansion. First, a network is constructed from reply -tweets of an airline's name as a search term on twitter. Ten different reply tweet networks are generated for ten US airlines. These networks represent how twitter users interact with each other when discussing an airline. Subgraph analysis is a tool that can be used to determine  the sparsity of the network in a more effective way. This study uses four node subgraph analysis on those twitter interaction networks. Consequently, this research finds out that different reply-tweet networks have different percentage s of four node subgraphs percentages among them. Those subgraph percentages indicate market expansion of airlines. Following that, this research develops a statistical model which demonstrates  the relation between subgraph percentages of an airlines’ tweet reply network and operating profit for corresponding airlines.  In addition to that, text mining analysis has been implemented to show which words are most used by users when discussing an airline. Keywords Graph theory, twitter, subgraph, airlines, market. Introduction The emergence of information technology in recent years has greatly contributed to the acceleration of social media use. Social media is a place where a user can not only generate and share content but also exchange and collaborate with other users  (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010) . Nowadays, all small to big businesses have their own social media accounts on which they interact with users. In addition to that, users also interact with each other when discussing the business that they follow (Mangold & Faulds, 2009) . By communicating with the users, businesses build a loyal relationship with the users. Consequently, businesses can also develop effective marketing strategies according to their user needs, and priority (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010) . Indeed, users nowadays value statements made on social media more than statements made on other media (Constantinides & Efthymios, 2010). Consequently, businesses use information on social media for developing their market strategy, developing their market value, and measuring their market expansion (Chan & Guillet, 2011). As social media users give their opinion on Facebook/Twitter, businesses can do text mining analysis on those status or tweets to get valuable insights on their products and services (Mostafa, 2013). This type of research is known as sentiment analysis and opinion mining . Consequently, it is gaining a lot of attention for market research (Ravi & Ravi, 2015). Machine learning and behavioral economics can be implemented together for market predictions too (Khan et al., 2023; Islam et al., 2023; Rabbi et al., 2023) . Additionally, supply chain issues in the food industries can be identified by gathering and processing relevant tweets  (Singh, Shukla, & Mishra, 2018) . Social media data can also be successfully used for product planning by determining customer satisfaction and sentiment towards previous products (Jeong & Yoon, 2019).

The ability to strategize, plan for, and mitigate against SC disruption is a challenge that was not fully appreciated before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shown that SCs, while extensive, are neither highly reliable nor resilient. Our research objective was to determine how the extant literature addresses the impact of COVID-19 disruption on SC reliability and resilience.  Further, we sought to investigate the mitigating actions practitioners took during this disruption through the lens of High Reliability Organi zations (HROs) and use this to inform and improve the operationalized hallmarks of HROs. Our research discovered that most organizations applied at least one, and many applied multiple practices indicative of the mindful practices of HROs, although not one article specifically mentioned HRO as a theory they put into practice. We used the literature to improve the definitions of the operationalized hallmarks of HRO to make them more useful for practitioners. Keywords High Reliability Organization (HRO), Supply Chain Resilience, Supply Chain Disruption Introduction During the COVID -19 pandemic, Supply Chains ( SCs) for virtually every industry faced multifaceted risks which disrupted their operations (Bier et al., 2020; Bruinen de Bruin et al., 2020; Craighead et al., 2020) .  The immediate and strong impact of pandemic-caused disruptions affected structural elements in the SC, availability of raw materials, product flow, delays in order delivery, workforce shortages or surplus, sharp changes in demand patterns causing productivity fluctuations, economic disadvantages, and low service levels  (Bruinen de Bruin et al., 2020; Ivanov, 2020).  In the manufacturing sector, for example, COVID-19 caused a double impact: the endogenous disruption of manufacturing processes and systems coupled with the strong exogenous shifts in supply and demand (Okorie et al., 2020).  This combination of unique and dynamic disruptions was never before experienced globally. Until the pandemic, most SC disruptions were relatively local ized and manageable . COVID-19, however, introduced such a wide -reaching impact from a variety of threats coupled with the cascading effects of unavailable human resources such that SCs globally suffered a significant impact. The COVID -19 pandemic took everyone by surprise, including (or perhaps especially) global SCs. The lack of strategy, planning, and mitigation is understandable given the relatively recent globalization of the lean, inter-networked supply chain.

46,PREDICTING MATERNAL HEALTH RISK BY UTILIZING DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS,@astate.edu,"Maternal Health, Healthcare, Machine Learning, Risk Level Detection","During pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, maternal health is crucial to a woman's well -being. A lack of maternal health knowledge puts pregnant women at greater likelihood of health issues that could cause a miscarriage, and some of them die from pregnancy -related illnesses. Maternal morbidity and mortality can be increased by a number of risk factors, such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and heart rate, though not all factors have an equal effect. Some of them; howeve r, might make things riskier. This is a worrying situation that is escalating rapidly in a developing country like Bangladesh. To ensure the health of both the mother and the unborn child during pregnancy, high-quality care is required throughout the postpartum period. Since both mother and infant have a greater risk of dying within the first week, both should be monitored closely. In the early stages of pregnancy- related symptoms, categorizing risk factors will be useful for reducing pregnancy -related difficulties. In  response, using machine learning, computers can automatically learn from data in order to make predictions and decision- making having a great deal of efficacy and precision. This study will utilize four popular machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K -Nearest Neighbors, and Naïve Bayes  to develop a model based on several predictors, tune, and cross-validate them, and select the best model that can accurately predict maternal health risk. Keywords Maternal Health, Healthcare, Machine Learning, Risk Level Detection Introduction Maternal health refers to the health of a woman during and after childbirth. A woman is more susceptible to health problems during this period. During pregnancy, even a minor illness can affect the immune system. Despite significant advancements over the past 20 years, according to (Roser & Ritchie) in 2017 alone, a variety of factors associated to childbirth, 300,000 women ended up dying . The prevalence of bleeding, infections, high blood pressure, unsafe abortions, and other factors increases the number o f fatalities during childbirth. Additionally, 287,000 women died during and shortly after giving birth in 2020, which is too high. In nations with low and lower middle wages, 95% of maternal fatalities take place. (WHO, 2023). It is possible to prevent the majority of maternal deaths if a qualified health practitioner intervenes promptly in a caring environment. The world must continue to focus on eliminating unnecessary maternal deaths. Obstetric patients are affected by several factors such as age, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, heart rate, etc. By keeping an eye on these levels and regularly monitoring the patient's health, we can determine whether they are in a high- or low-risk zone. To comprehend their current predicament, it is also necessary to assess their risk intensity level. Taking preventive action after determining the levels may save a mother and her unborn child in the end. In this context, the application of machine learning can help doctors identify the level of risk. In the recent past, machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated a level of effectiveness equal to or greater than that of humans  (Gulshan, Peng, & Coram, 2016). Machine learning's application in healthcare has the potential to significantly enhance the healthcare industry. Assisting physicians in their decision-making as well as providing them with assistance is the main reason why many private sectors have incorporated machine learning into health care (Char, Shah, & Magnus, 2018).

The search for new or improved approaches to the economics of higher education systems is a pressing issue for researchers and practitioners alike.  Thermoe conomics is an approach to defining and modeling economic systems by how they consume limited resources to achieve profitability or advance society.  Applying thermoeconomic concepts to the economics of higher education offers a novel way of visualizing th e dynamics of the higher education market.  This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of articles from peer -reviewed journals and published books involving the development of thermoeconomic models and their application to complex systems lik e the economics of higher education in the United States.  The SLR uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to ensure analysis transparency and minimize researcher bias risks.  The review excludes sou rces that take a utilitarian and practical approach in applying a thermodynamic exergy analysis regarding an energy conversion system ’s economic purchase and operating costs (exergoeconomic analysis).  The results of the SLR identify gaps between the intersection of thermoeconomics and the economics of higher education. The study notes that there is an opportunity for further research to close the knowledge ga ps in the development of models of the economics of higher education based on thermoeconomic principles.  Furthermore, potential new economic models that might impact future research, influence policies, and assist in developing strategies for economic decisions regarding higher education are explored. Keywords Thermodynamics, Economics, Thermoeconomics, Systematic Literature Review, Higher Education, Economics of Higher Education. Introduction Thermoeconomics arose from the concept that economic wealth is a derivative of energy.  What is economics but creating wealth through the useful manipulation and conversion of energy?  Economic wealth is, therefore, beholden to the same principle of conservation that mass and energy are in the First Law of Thermodynamics.  Economic wealth can neither be created nor destroyed but only transformed from one form to another.  Take, for instance, the processing of aluminum into raw material for manufacturing a final good.  Aluminum does not exist in its pure form in the ground but as bauxites which are mixtures of aluminum oxides and other minerals.  These bauxites must be mined from the ground using energy and wealth like human labor, capital equipment, and fuels consumed directly through combustion or indirectly via electricity.  These bauxites have an intrinsic value associated with their recovery from the soil because of their availability in the ground, the energy consumed to extract them, and the anticipated  final product(s) made from them.  Therefore, the “wealth” of aluminum is only available due to energy and can likewise be described and defined in terms of energy.  Taking it a step further, even the bauxites are only available due to various energy conversions during the initial formation of the Sun, the solar system, and the Earth.  The conservation of wealth principle is the initial isomorphology between the classical disciplines of thermodynamics and economics. Furthermore, after the generation of wealth, it is generally consumed, degrading its value to the point that the original wealth is depleted and no longer useful.  The depletion of wealth presents a second isomorphology between the disciplines, which is the concept of entropy.  Entropy, defined as a lack of available thermal energy within a system that is convertible to useful work, is the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

49,DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEMS FOR ALIGNING TEAM THINKING AND DOING,@oregonstate.edu,"Performance appraisal, performance barriers, patterns of team behavior, systems thinking","Research has shown that team performance appraisals can be useful tools for engineering managers to be informed on the current state of their team. Engineering managers can use performance appraisals to evaluate team morale and attitude toward goals. Performance appraisals can give engineering managers insights into challenges the team might encounter that are not evident from performance metrics alone.  Engineering managers can react more appropriately to team challenges by finding where barriers, or the removal thereof, inhibit or enable team progress. While traditional performance measurement systems can provide engineering managers with transitory assessments of team status, they often do not track long- term progress while simultaneously accounting for the context in which the team operates . Existing tools also often focus primarily on team social dynamics, which contributes to understanding a team’s cohesion but not how to orient a team toward success. Currently, no appraisal system supplies a continuous and systemic assessment that compliments team performance. In this paper, the authors propose that by tracking long-term progress toward goals, emergent patterns of team behavior reveal how the systemic structure of a team affects its ability to reach its goals. To begin an exploration of a holistic performance appraisal system, we develop a conceptual model that addresses current gaps in existing systems while providing engineering managers a comprehensive overview of their team in relation to challenges and barriers. For engineering managers to maintain high-performing teams, team thinking and doing can be aligned by implementing a holistic performance appraisal system. Keywords Performance appraisal, performance barriers, patterns of team behavior, systems thinking Introduction Performance measurement (PM) has long been recognized as a crucial practice in engineering teams , yet current practices, while useful, provide a partial view of a team’s  performance in modern complex organizations (Deidra J. Schleicher et al., 2019; Robert S. Kaplan & David P. Norton, 1993; Senge, 1 990; Spitzer, 2007) . T raditional performance indicators are typically static in nature: often defined in advance, and may not be adjusted in response to changing organizational priorities or shifting contextual factors  (Spitzer, 2007) . These factors may lead to an incomplete assessment of team performance or hinder an organization’s ability to respond to evolving demands as the velocity of change in work environments increases.  Changes in work environments  are driven by factors such as heightened competition, globalization, and technological advancements, which necessitate that organizations become more adaptive to the continuously shifting business environment (McCarthy et al., 2010) . Coupled with this , the growing use of digital technologies and the transition of many engineering teams to remote work has made monitoring team performance more challenging for engineering managers (Lumseyfai, 2020). As a result of these chall enges, there exists a gap in the mechanism through which we review and adapt our PM  systems (Bititci et al., 2000; Elaine D. Pulakos & Ryan S. O’Leary , 2011). To ensure the efficacy and relevance of a PM system, which evaluates the congruence between team  behavior and organizational goals, facilitates decision-making, and aid s in  monitoring performance trends, organizations must adopt  measurement strategies that are capable of capturing the complexity and fluidity of contemporary work environments where the nature of job expectations may change rapidly over time. Measurement systems of this nature can enable organizations to better respond to the evolving needs and priorities of the organization and assist managers in making informed decisions to improve team performance. By implementing a framework for dynamic and continuous evaluation and evolution of the PM system (Deidra J.

The DoD’s reliance on energy indicates that national energy infrastructure plays a significant role in military readiness and national defense.  Recent cyber-attacks have exposed vulnerabilities within U.S. energy infrastructure that could have detrimental effects if the target of these attacks shifts to neutralizing the operational ability of military installations.  This study focuses on identifying a proof of concept for the methodology that could be used to determine which Army installations are most vu lnerable based on their position within a given energy network.  Specifically, this methodology focuses on the maximum flow and minimum cut algorithms that identify the fewest edges that need to be removed in a network to completely stop the flow of material from a source node to a sink node.   In the context of energy infrastructure, these algorithms are applied to a proxy energy network to determine which Army installations are most vulnerable based on the number of edges within their minimum cut set.  If provided access to national energy infrastructure data, this methodology can be used to determine which Army installations need additional energy resources based on vulnerabilities within the network. Keywords Critical energy infrastructure, energy networks, Army installations, Maximum flow, Minimum cut. Introduction The DoD has recently begun to recognize risks associated with its vast reliance on national energy infrastructure for military operations.  As a result, the Army has begun to conduct  a series of  Energy Readiness Exercises  that test installation resiliency during the case of a severe power outage.  Installations are evaluated based on how well they maintain operational capabilities during an extended utility blackout.  These current exercises measure the extent to which current Army installations would be able to respond to a potential energy hack .  By focusing on actions that occur because of a loss of energy access, these tests fail to address actions that could lend to a more proactive approach to improving Army installation energy resiliency.  This study provides proof of concept for using a maximum flow and minimum cut methodology that could help to identify the most vulnerable Army installations within an energy network.  Provided access to this information, the impacts of a hack on energy infrastructure could be reduced by ensuring the most vulnerable installations are prioritized for proper resources and alternative energy options. Background As the world continues to develop accessibility to new technology  through the expansion of technological infrastructure, opportunities for cyber-attacks are becoming more prevalent.  Since 2013, the number of recorded malicious cyber-attacks has risen by 67% and a growing number of these attacks involve critical infrastructure relating to energy systems (Plėta, Tvaronaviciene, Casa, & Agafonov, 2021).  This presents a significant problem as the current energy landscape is not equipped to combat the increasing number of cyber-attacks.  The impacts of these cyber- attacks on critical energy infrastructure pose a threat to national security as they disrupt operational readiness within the DoD.  The D oD accounts for 77% of federal energy consumption which highlights the importance of reliable energy access within its operations (OASD, 2020).  Broken down further, the Army accounts for the largest portion of the DoD’s energy consumption at 36%, revealing a need for the Army to identify ways to ensure reliable energy access despite the threat of cyber -attacks.

Predicting economic change is a complex challenge that depends on many factors.  Agent-based and machine-learning approaches are increasingly promising methods to address this challenge.   Agent-based models have the advantage of modeling the interactions between different economic agents in real-time. This allows a detailed analysis of the impact of changes in a particular part of the system on the whole system. However, those models have the disadvantage that they are very data-intensive and require careful calibration to provide realistic results.  Machine learning offers a different approach to predicting economic change.  Models can be trained on large data sets to identify complex patterns in the data to make predictions.  This approach has the benefits of being very flexible and able to account for complex relationships between different variables.  The disadvantage is that it can be challenging to  interpret the results of these models as they are based on black box algorithms.  This paper seeks to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches and how they can contribute to the problem of financial and economic uncertainty.  A preliminary literature review analyzes the main features, assumptions, and limitations of agent -based and machine-learning models and their potential to provide insight into economic systems' complex and dynamic nature.  This research will provide a critical brea kdown of the current state of the art in the current literature in this area of study that benefits researchers and practitioners alike. Keywords Agent-based modeling, machine learning, economics, complexity, dynamics, system Introduction Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noted at the Annual Meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in October 2022 that in the last three years, we have gone through several severe crises after a decade of stability:  First Covid, then the Russian war against Ukraine, which led to an energy crisis and finally to a surge in inflation rates and food prices in world's economies.  Therefore, she stated that “we are experiencing a fundamental shift in the global economy:  From a world of relative predictability […] to a world with more fragility - greater uncertainty, higher economic volatility, geopolitical confrontations, and more frequent and devastating natural disasters - a world in which any country can be thrown off course more easily and more often.” (Georgieva, 2022) Today's economy is a complex and dynamic system influenced by many factors and is globally connected.  One challenge that has emerged from recent crises is facing and managing economic and financial uncertainty.  Both companies and governments are interest ed in making predictions about economic changes to prepare for potential risks and take advantage of opportunities. For policymakers, however, knowing what factors drive the change and, more importantly, the consequences of controlling interventions can be essential. Various fields try to predict the future, but it's not always accurate. Emerging risks are hard to predict due to uncertainty, lack of information, conflicting data, and cognitive biases. However, progress is possible. Better risk identification and foresi ght can help with decision -making, agenda -setting, and resilience measures. Prioritizing data collection , risk controls, resources, and redundancies are essential (Heading et al., 2023). This is where agent -based modeling, which has enjoyed popularity in economics and social sciences for some time, comes into play.  It allows complex systems to be modeled in the computer and their future development to be simulated (Gilbert, 2008).

52,INVENTORY CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION OF REORDER POINT: A CASE STUDY,@gmail.com,"Simulation, inventory, stochastic, optimization","When dealing with inventory control, sim-lean tools can help analyze several key variables simultaneously, allowing the software to manipulate them to find the optimal points that satisfy the system parameters. Failing to maintain an adequate supply of spare parts at an aluminum recycling plant can lead to significant delays in the operational process and excessive production downtime. Conversely, excessive on-hand inventory of these parts can result in additional holding costs. This paper details how an accurate ( S,s) inventory simulation model was constructed for this facility and used to determine optimal reorder points and target stock levels for the most regularly consumed parts to minimize cost. The simulation uses variable expressions to represent lead time, demand, and demand frequency. Using stochastic distributions rather than deterministic constants reflects the real-world scenario and allows for a more precise, reliable solution produced by the simulation. OptQuest in Arena allows for iterative trials to hone in on precise optimal solutions. The optimal points for the parameters of interest, reorder point, and target stock level can be found by systematically altering these levels. Optimized inventory levels and reorder points will lead to more efficient production. Smoothing demand with discrete distributions allows predictability for the demand system. Optimized inventory control levels are found to reduce inefficiency, but implementation cannot be validated due to time limitations. Keywords Simulation, inventory, stochastic, optimization Introduction Classic methods for determining reorder points (ROP) and safety stock levels ignore the inherent variability of lead time and demand. Methods like economic order quantity (EOQ) require the assumption that demand and lead time are deterministic and will not change. This makes the calculation of ROP and safety stock simple but at the risk of experiencing a delay in the system because the deterministic values used to calculate these levels do not truly reflect the real world. Adaptations of the classic EOQ model exist to attempt to take variability in demand into account using ‘fuzzy’ EOQ. In these models, the calculations are done using fuzzy numbers as opposed to deterministic constants (Samal et al, 2014). However, this method is better suited for situations where demand is unknown, such as in the case of a new product. Fuzzy EOQ works best with limited historical data and can be a useful tool (Björk, 2009), however, simulation can be used to calculate a more precise answer that takes variability into account. Simulation has the benefit of considering as many stochastic variables as needed for an accurate representation of a system. One study developed a model back in 1972 that treated demand frequency and demand quantity as two separate variables (Croston, 1972). Because of this, the simulation is more reflective of the real world and allows for better solutions. Another study in 2005 (Krever et al, 2003) expanded on this concept and set demand to be generated based on single-demand quantities as opposed to a period-demand approach. This resulted in more accurate demand during lead time, which allowed for the selection of a better reorder point. The highly customized nature of the spare parts used in the facility also indicates that an accurate representation of lead time is not negligible (Zahedi-Hosseini et al, 2017). An (S,s) model, in particular, sets a target stock level and reorder point. Traditionally, a safety stock level is chosen to mitigate the risk of delay in the system due to the unavailability of  parts. There is typically a preference for a higher safety stock level as opposed to a high amount of delays because the impact of a delay is often much more costly than the additional holding cost of the safety stock (Sarker et al, 2000).",gmail.com,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

One of the clean energy technologi es is waste heat to power (WHP), which has recently been eligible for the tax credit since 2021. WHP is the process of generating electricity by collecting heat emitted by existing thermal processes in refineries, steel mills, and cement plants. It is diff erent from combined heat and power (CHP) in that CHP is a form of distributed generation, with a prime mover, a generator and a heat recovery system. Additional electric generation from using the wasted heat is equivalent to less need for electric supply o therwise from existing carbon -emitting generation facilities. Despite the fact that  the WHP technologies  are mature, they have not significantly penetrated into the energy markets in U.S. or on a global scale, relative to solar and wind  technologies. There are challenges to address for the WHP technology to join the main stream of the CO2 reduction portfolio. This paper examines the WHP technology and current market penetration with public incentives, followed by exploring economic and operational potentials, as well as the ways to address the challenges the WHP faces in marketplace. This research also serves as a case study to contribute to the engineering management field, particularly, the domain of management of minority technology, research, and development. Keywords Waste heat to power, waste heat recovery, investment tax credit, CO2 reduction, organic rankine cycle (ORC) Introduction There are unprecedented forest fires in the Western U.S., tropical storms and rising seas in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) notes that main keys to a successful energy transition are clean energy and electric vehicles. The Biden Administration’s announcement to reduce emissions 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 is a critical first step of a global energy transition, to avert the worst impacts of climate change (World Resources Institute, 2022 ; The White House, 2021). The Administration was focusing on the power sector that would be carbon pollution free by 2035 (The White House, 2021). Six analysis studies show that 70% to 90% of the emission reduction should come from electric power  and transport sectors with declining costs of solar and wind. With support roles of natural gas, nuclear, and hydro, 10% to 25% of the reduction  is related to a transition to electric light vehicles. Electric vehicles accounted for 4% of new car sales in U.S., but the share should be 34% to 100% by 2023 to meet the emission reduction target (Reilly, 2022). Energy tax credit in U.S. was first enacted in 1978, providing 10% credit on business energy property and equipment using resources other than oil or gas. Since then, there have been a series of addition of new energy technology or credit extensions to date (Congressional Research Service, 2021). The U.S. business energy investment credit (ITC) is a federal corporate tax credit, and eligible technologies are renewable and other technologies including waste energy recovery under 50 MW, and storage technologies using lithium-ion batteries. In general, the base credit is 6% to 30% depending on a technology, and additional bonus credit may be available for domestic contents, energy community, or low-income community (DSIRE, 2022). According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), 20% to 50% of industrial energy input is lost as waste heat in the form of exhaust gas, cooling water, heat lost from hot equipment surfaces and heated products (NC Clean Energy Technology Center, 2021) . Three major sources of waste heat are thermal process (furnace operations), mechanical drive (pipeline compression stations), and other systems (exothermic reactions used to manufacture",kentech.ac.kr,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
55,ONLINE EDUCATION IN WORKFOCE ENGAGEMENT,@uark.edu,"Online Education, Workforce Engagement","Washington State University’s Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) online master’s degree program offers graduate level courses that teach engineering and business leaders how to improve systems with a management approach that promotes employee engagement.  Student perceptions of learning workforce engagement principles in an online environment were assessed based on a Likert scale survey.  The survey was structured to measure functional satisfaction related to online education using the Canvas learning management system and Zoom for live online class sessions.  The survey also measured perceptions of learning and demonstration of knowledge from the online course. Finally, the survey measured personal preferences related to online learning.  The results of the survey reveal ed that the majority of students were satisfied with the technological aspects of online courses and felt that they learned and were able to demonstrate workforce engagement principles.  However, less than half of the students reported having a personal preference for online learning.  Online engineering management education is multifaceted, and efforts will continue to be made to improve this area of education based on the results of this study. Keywords Online Education, Workforce Engagement Introduction Washington State University’s (WSU) Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) department provides a fully online master’s degree in which classes are taught live-online via Zoom video conferences on weekday evenings, and each class is recorded for students who prefer to watch the recordings at their convenience.  Live-online classes make it possible for online education to help overcome the common misconception that online learning is a solitary, self - paced, non-instructor led activity (Bourne, Harris, & Mayadas, 2005), and it retains the social and participation aspects that are a key factor in the success of online learning (Richardson & Swan, 2003).  The 2010 meta-analysis performed by the U.S. Department of Education  (DOE, 2010)  found that, on average, students in online learning conditions actually performed modestly better than those receiving face -to-face only instruction.  Thus, the live-online learning method employed by the WSU ETM department is an effective and convenient environment for industry leaders to learn the tools required in engineering management while working full-time. Background Workforce engagement is a critical component of engineering management education.  Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez- Roma and Bakker (2002) defined engagement as a positive, fulfilling, work -related state of mind which is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption.  Vigor is characterized by elevated levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties. Dedication is characterized by a sense of significanc e, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.  Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and deeply engrossed in one’s work. Engagement is the state of being passionately commit ted to a cause, and Author Lonnie Wilson has applied this definition of engagement at work and thus coined the phrase “workforce engagement”.  Being an engineering manager includes the most basic task of management which is supervision.  Supervision ideally means “to do all t hat is necessary to make your subordinates as successful as possible” (Wilson, 2019).  Supervisors must take responsibility for the skills and outcomes of their workers  which requires that the supervisor knows what to do, how to do it, and has the resources to do it.  These are all management responsibilities and fall within the subject matter of engineering management education.  Without a fully engaged workforce consisting of people that have the curiosity, courage, and initiative for continuous improvement efforts, productivity gains tend to diminish over time (Wilson, 2015).",uark.edu,University of Arkansas - Fayetteville,United States,36.0970389,-94.17033216657404
56,LEAN SIX SIGMA FOR MICRO BUSINESSES IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY,@uncc.edu,"LSS, DMAIC, Service Industry, Microbusiness, Custom Service","The purpose of this case study is to explore the use of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in microbusinesses specifically in the custom services industry. The goal is to demonstrate the intersectionality between the custom services industry and LSS particularly in service industries where there is limited research. In order to investigate how LSS can be employed in microbusinesses, a specific microbusiness  company was evaluated as a specific case . The DMAIC methodology was applied and adapted to fit the specific needs of th is business. From the implementation of LSS techniques , the business was able to identify areas of improvement in their business process. Keywords LSS, DMAIC, Service Industry, Microbusiness, Custom Service Introduction Microbusinesses are a subset of the term ‘small business ’ and The Small Business Administration classifies microbuisinesses as those with up to nine  employees (Murray, 2020). A literature survey on small businesses and service industry has been conducted for this study. Literature shows that some smaller businesses recognize the benefits of LSS but with budgetary considerations and there is a need to ensure business continuity while applying and following implementation o f LSS in small businesses (Six Sigma for Small Business, 2014) . Even though there is some awareness of LSS utilization in small businesses there is still a considerable amount of doubt as small busineseses may require some adaptations  (Pyzdek, 2010). In regard to small businesses, there are buy-in steps that must first take place. There is a necessity to have some amount of available data , a means to collect pertinent information about the business , commitment to the implementation process and to improving the business based on customer needs (Rodriguez, 2022). Methods used in previous research implementing LSS require an understanding of the readiness of a small business for introducing LSS, understanding the performance and key success factors for a business as well as evaluating process steps and deliverables. There is also a need to comprehend the tools, techniques, duties of subject matter experts, prioritization and implications of implementation of LSS (Jiju Antony, S,Vinodh, E.V Gijo, 2016). LSS is an underemployed methodology in service or customer-facing industries (Oracle, 2003). Common themes in reviewing literature regarding LSS and t he service industry include the ongoing need to minimize waste and implement customer focused improvements  (J., n.d.) . Methods used to  improve service -based industries include DMAIC, surveys, document analysis, observations, data collection, and understanding performance factors . These methods aided in introducing solutions that can be sustained and eliminate non value add activities in industries where there are differing root causes, differing ways to measure success and even custom service offerings meaning not all process steps are repeatable. Literature includes limited number of studies  on LSS application in  microbusinesses in the service industry . These gaps in research surrounding the small service industries are fueled by general unfamiliarity with the Six Sigma methodology outside of the manufacturing industry . In addition,  in the case of small businesses, typically there are fewer resources that can be applied to these efforts  (Oracle, 2003). Research has been conducted in many service industries such as the food, legal, and customer service sectors displaying LSS as an effective process improvement methodology. However, utilizing this methodology in service requires some considerations and adaptations depending on the business structure.",uncc.edu,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,United States,35.30649445,-80.843124
57,PREPARING POLL WORKERS TO SECURE U.S. ELECTIONS,@towson.edu,"Election security, Infrastructure vulnerability, Infrastructure risk management, Insider risk.","The security concerns surrounding the 2016 and 2020 United States Presidential Elections have underscored the critical importance of election security, prompting a renewed emphasis on preventing, detecting, and mitigating emerging threats associated with election infrastructure. With their pivotal role as the first line of defense on Election Day, poll workers bear the responsibility of identifying and thwarting any potential threats that may arise. Moreover, they possess unsupervised access to the U.S. critical infrastructure ele ctions equipment at polling places and are entrusted with administering the election processes at their local precincts. However, despite their crucial role, poll workers receive minimal, if any, specific training on security threats prior to elections.  To address this gap,  this research investigates poll worker threat awareness through developing, piloting, and empirically evaluating online training modules aimed at teaching poll workers to identify and mitigate potential cyber, physical, and insider threats that may arise prior to, and on, Election Day. Through statistical analysis of a pre -post-test study involving eligible and current poll workers, this research demonstrates  the effectiveness of these training modules  to significantly enhance poll workers' understanding of cyber, physical, and insider threats associated with the processes  of three critical areas in voting: electronic pollbooks, the scanning unit, and provisional voting. The implications of this work emphasize the need for resources for election officials and managers to provide effective and  comprehensive poll worker training and, thus, ensure the security and integrity of U.S. election processes. Keywords Election security, Infrastructure vulnerability, Infrastructure risk management, Insider risk. Introduction The 2016 and 2020 U .S. Presidential Elections were unparalleled, as mainstream media, U.S. government and intelligence agencies, and subsequent judicial court proceedings established prevalent interference by foreign actors along with mis/disinformation narratives regarding the integrity of votes and voting processes.  These events brought a renewed focus on election integrity to the extent that  in 2017 the  Department of Homeland Security designated Election Infrastructure as a subsector of national critical infrastructure under the Government Facilities sector. Locraft, et al. (2019) and Price, et al. (2019) identified that threats to elections security can occur at both the state and local levels and were the first to recognize that a holistic cyber, physical, and insider approach should be taken to mitigate threat. Polling places serve as the crucial interface between the public and election processes, making them the starting point for ensuring security as they handle the majority of votes cast and recorded. The nearly one million poll workers needed to facilit ate voting during a presidential election cycle are the first line of defense in elections security, but they need to be trained to be aware of real-time threats that may evolve on Election Day. As elections are primarily one-day events, they cannot be redone or postponed, so the security and integrity of the votes cast must be maintained throughout the entire process. Poll workers need knowledge of threats and to be empowered to mitigate or manage issues that may arise. This research investigates poll  worker threat awareness through the development of online training modules to educate poll workers about potential cyber, physical, and insider threats that may arise on Election Day and tests the efficacy of those modules via a pre-post-test. Evidence from the statistical analysis suggests that cyber, physical, and insider threat knowledge of current and potential poll  workers increases after interacting with the training modules. We consider a mid -Atlantic state that uses p recinct count optical scanners  (PCOS) as our case study and developed training module(s) for every station that the public uses at a polling place.

The complex functions requirement, multiple product process, burdensome regulations and tight specifications bring the medical device NPD processes with full of challenges and risks. However, even in the final stages of NPD, Product Transfer and Launch, there are still many problems. For example: document approval, cross -departmental collaboration, equipment adjustment, personnel training, mass produ ction management, etc. These issues lead to significant delays, cost overruns, nonconforming product and customer complaints. This study combines the literature review and case analysis of the problems and practices of the NPD department of a medical devic e manufacturing company in the United States, and draws some useful conclusions and strategies for the transfer risk of NPD between Research and Development (R&D) and production: (1) Adjusted NPD Cross -Functional Management to allow production team to participate earlier to prevent potential risks in mass production in advance;(2) Made product-result- oriented pre-control or control plan based on design verification and process verification with appropriate sampling plan;(3) Integrated risk management into N PD, production and post -production process.

Keywords New Product Development, Operation Management, Medical Device Manufacturing, Risk Analysis. Introduction New Product Development (NPD) is the outpost of enterprise innovation. Since 2019, Covid-19 pandemic has brought multiple challenges to most industries. In the face of Covid -19 challenges, agile NPD and supply chain become an effective strategy for enterprises to increase competitiveness (ÇETİNDAŞ & ÖZTÜRK, 2020). In the medical field, the NPD process is more complicated. In addition to strict regulations, precise design requirements and specifications, under global supply chain background, the medical devi ce component, such as a ventilator or pacemaker, may come from different suppliers or manufacturers. NPD process become the quality guarantor before mass production because it conducted risk pre-analysis and experimental verification of the entire manufact uring process. Global competitive pressures have reduced product lifecycles (Jou et al., 2010). For the NPD department of medical device manufacturers, reducing R&D time and non-conformance report (NCR) has undoubtedly become an important criterion for evaluating the success of NPD process. The overall development time of NPD process usually lasts from 6 months to 1 year, depending on the complexity of the project. However, when the NPD process is completed, manufacturers still face a large number of problems in the mass production phase, suc h as delayed document approval, barriers to cross -sectoral collaboration, operational technical issues, equipment issues, inadequate personnel training, production management, etc. Unfortunately, these problems will lead to delays, waste, cost increases and customer complaints.

59,A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT TRAINING TECHNIQUES,@tec.mx,"Systematic Literature Review, Systematic Mapping, Project Management, Simulation, System Dynamics","Today’s workplace can put immense pressure on its workforce to meet the expectations of within budget and on-time delivery of work. One antidote to this issue is training the workforce in effective Project Management (PM) techniques, tools, and strategies. Typically, there are implicit expectations of high-productivity outcomes from the workforce upon being provided PM training, given the usually significant investments of time, money, and effort. In addition, there seems to be a growth in the expectation o f and need for PM training that is shorter in duration and is as effective, if not more. There has also been significant growth in the availability of PM -related courses owing to developments in education technologies and the requirement for such courses due to the increasing objectification of work. Despite the access to educational content, practitioners may often have to contend with a workplace notion that “real” PM is far greater than what is learned through courses. Consequently, more may come to be e xpected of such educational content, and they may be required to provide more comprehensive training. In order to understand how to make PM training more effective and affordable (monetarily and through lower time investments), the diversity of training techniques available first needs to be mapped. To address this objective, this study applies a combination of the PRISMA protocol and State-of-the-Art Matrix (SAM) analysis to the extant literature and discusses the results of the literature search. Keywords Systematic Literature Review, Systematic Mapping, Project Management, Simulation, System Dynamics Introduction Project Management (PM) is defined as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and technologies to project activities to achieve the goals according to the requirements” (Hedvicakova & Svobodova, 2018). According to Hedvicakova & Svobodova (2018), 15. 7 million new PM roles will be created between 2010 and 2020. The projectification of work has changed the way organizations and people manage it. This has caused an increase in demand for skilled PM personnel, and the importance of PM to organizations can not be understated. Therefore, effective talent management through PM education is vital for organizations. A recent report revealed a talent shortfall in project-oriented sectors globally. Jaaska et al. (2022a) state that this challenge can be addressed by training the workforce in applicable PM skills rooted in real-life scenarios. Jaaska and Aaltonen (2022b) noted that education to prepare project managers must have a practical approach to handling the project complexity and skills development instead of just a theoretical approach (Jääskä & Aaltonen, 2022b). However, Nijhuis (2021) found that PM training, eve n though plentiful, is primarily academic. Tiruvengadam et al.

60,A REVIEW OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENTIFIC METHODS USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING APPROACHES,@tec.mx,"Systematic Literature Review, Systematic Mapping, Project Management, Simulation, System Dynamics","With the rapid pace of technological development, there has been a constant increase in the pressure on professionals to remain updated to stay relevant and competitive in their disciplines. Timely training is one way of alleviating such anxiety. However, training itself brings issues from both organizational and individual perspectives, like the effectiveness of content, time away from work, and the cost of training tools. From a corporate perspective, allocating finite financial resources to training initiatives could be predicated on the effectiveness and efficiency of training tools. Consequently, the possibility for a scientific objective assessment of available training tools opens. As a first step towards addressing this goal, this work reviews the st ate-of-the-art science of measuring the effectiveness of diverse training techniques like coaching, workshops, computer -based simulators, boot camps, Etc. This work is based on applying the PRISMA protocol and the State-of-the-Art Matrix (SAM) methodology to extant literature. A vital result of this study for engineering managers is that it creates a path forward for future contributions in developing quantitative techniques to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of diverse training approaches. Keywords Systematic Literature Review, Systematic Mapping, Project Management, Simulation, System Dynamics Introduction The growing interest in Project Management (PM) and its impact on attaining organizational goals is evident because of its relationship to every process (Neverauskas & Railaitė, 2013). Project management has become the backbone of project direction and administration. Nevertheless, some project managers have tried to create a tangible approach to rely on time, budget, and quality measures as a strategy to manage projects. However, the tactic often fails because of the ambiguity in establishing appropriate project goals (Norrie & Walker, 2004). The current p rojectification in varied professional fields has made visible the need for training methods that shorten the learning curve of project management trainees . Despite PM ’s ubiquity, project managers encount er challenges in enhancing the effectiveness and upholding the viability of projects through diverse industries. The rate of success of projects exhibits a decay due to deficiencies in knowledge, skills, resources, and technology throughout the project's e xecution (Mahdi et al., 2021 ; Ramazani & Jergeas, 2015 ). Finding an appropriate training method to simulate a realistic environment is complicated (Jääskä et al., 2022). According to the Project Management Institution (PMI), between 2010 and 2020, 15.7 million new PM positions will be created. The constant increase of PM roles demands many universities to prepare their students  to transition effectively towards those positions and face the obstacles of improving the efficiency and maintenance of projects during implementation. Therefore, training becomes essential not only to industry project managers but also to higher education institutions. A need for broader learning experiences is required to teach PM. Teaching in different ways allows engagement with the topic, but the transferable skills and attitudes must be evaluated to know the methodology's effectiveness (Ojiako et al., 2011).",tec.mx,,,46.3144754,11.0480288

Through a comprehensive literature review of academic papers and case studies in non-software industries such as construction, manufacturing, and oil & gas, successful applications of Agile and Lean practices are identified, highlighting their flexibility, cost -saving potential, and timely outcomes. The study proposes recommendations to incorporate Agile and Lean principles in renewable energy projects, emphasizing waste minimization, adaptability, resiliency, and flexibility. While demonstrating the potential benefits, it is crucial to acknowledge that further empirical studies and verification are needed to develop a tailored framework for implementing these methodologies in the renewable energy industry. Such future investigations will contribute to optimizing project performance and ensuring sustainable energy project delivery. Keywords Project Management, Renewable Energy Projects, Agile, Lean Introduction Renewable energy has emerged as a crucial component in addressing the challenges of climate change and transitioning towards a sustainable energy future. The share of renewable energy in the power sector has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, an d this trend is projected to continue. According to projections, the share of renewable energy in the power sector is expected to increase from 25% in 2015 to a remarkable 85% by 2050, while the share of renewable energy in the total primary energy supply is estimated to rise from 14% in 2015 to 63% by 2050 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019) . In the year 2022, the world witnessed an unprecedented increase in renewable energy capacity, with approximately 295 gigawatts (GW) of renewables added, resulting in a remarkable 9.6% increase in the stock of renewable power and contributing an astounding 83% of global power additions (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2023). These statistics underscore the significance of renewable energy as a dominant and sustainable energy source in the future, with its rapid expansion highlighting the importance of developing robust project management approaches to address the unique challe nges faced by renewable energy projects. Traditional project management approaches, characterized by linear and rigid frameworks like the Waterfall method, may not be well-suited to meet the dynamic nature of renewable energy projects. Stakeholders in renewable energy projects perceive formal project management as time -consuming, restrictive to creativity and flexibility, and potentially increasing the risk of failure (Pitagorsky, 2006). Renewable energy projects also present unique challenges to traditional project management. These challenges include evolving regulatory requirements, complex stakeholder engagement, long project lifecycles, and emerging technologies . Additionally, contemporary challenges related to social, technical, economic, and environmental aspects have emerged, including issues such as technical feasibility, energy efficiency, cost considerations, resource selection and location, and social acceptance (Al-Shetwi, 2022).",northeastern.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
62,THE PRODUCTIVITY-PROFIT ASSOCIATION: THE VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES OF THE DIVERSE METHODS OF PRODUCTIVITY EVALUATION,@kettering.edu,"Index, Fare-Primont, Cobb-Douglas, Return on Asset, parametric, nonparametric, DEA.","This study is a limited exploratory effort at furthering our understanding of the productivity-profit association by first evaluating multiple forms of firm productivity for their associations with each other and then with profit. The ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundations for future studies on the creation of a framework for the choice and use of various productivity metrics. This framework, when developed eventually, is intended for operations and engineering managers who seek to measure and improve productivity with the intent of influencing profitability based on the productivity-profit association. Accounting data on a small sample of manufacturing firms serve as the basis for this preliminary exploratory study. Parametric and non -parametric techniques for productivity measurement are presented and their computed productivity values are evaluated further for their association with each other and firm profit. The scope for future studies in this space is defined. Keywords Index, Fare-Primont, Cobb-Douglas, Return on Asset, parametric, nonparametric, DEA. Introduction Productivity is a well-researched topic (van Beveren, 2012; Coelli et al., 2005). As newer technologies and forms of work emerge, so does the notion of productivity evolve. Organizations and managers working for them need to adapt to the evolving workspace, by not only seeking to find ever -increasing ways for customer satisfaction but also measuring efficiencies of the value-creation process in a manner that will allow them influence firm performance. There currently are several forms of firm -level productivity measurement methods and metrics available to a practitioner. Singh, Motwani, & Kumar (2000) identified three approaches for measuring productivity, which are the Index method, Linear Programming, and Econometric Models. The Index method often uses ratios of outputs and inputs as a measure of productivity and tracks them over time.  The easily calculable Return on Assets (ROA) is one such example that is an oft-used proxy metric for productivity tha t provides information on how effectively a firm used all its assets to generate income (Bosch-Badia, 2010). The Linear Programming approach is rooted in Operations Research principles and seeks to optimize an objective function that defines efficiency as an aggregate of inputs and outputs. No assumptions are made concerning how the inputs and outputs are related, and hence such methods can be classified as non-parametric. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a prime example of this approach  (Cooper et al., 2011). Econometric Models of productivity measurement often go with an ex -ante assumption of a functional relationship between the outputs and the inputs () and in effect are parametric/semi -parametric in nature  (Cobb & Douglas, 1928; Coelli, 1998). This study is an exploratory, first-cut attempt at laying down the foundations for future studies on the inter - relatedness of the various firm-level productivity measures and to observe if they are independent of each other or can be supplementary to each other.  Previous studies have shown  parametric and non -parametric methods to be comparable in some instances and not as much in others (Hjalmarsson et al., 1996; Costa et al., 2015). Other studies have shown that productivity interacts with profit (Tiruvengadam et al., 2021a) and liquidity (Tiruv engadam et al., 2021b). We wished to build upon that knowledge by looking for similarities and differences between these metrics",kettering.edu,Kettering University,United States,43.014042200000006,-83.7140043528519

Moreover, dairy products are highly perishable with a limited lifetime. Therefore, designing an efficient and resilient s upply chain network for the industry is critical. The location of the distribution center, choice of the type of vehicles for transporting the products from location to location, loading strategy of the vehicles, and warehousing time play a crucial role to minimize the shortages of products at a retail store and reduce the price premium for the consumers. A mathematical model is developed in this paper to design an integrated dairy supply chain network and identify the optimal location of the distribution centers with an appropriate choice of vehicle size, loading strategy, and inventory level at different supply chain stages considering the freshness of the products, cost -effectiveness, and reliability. The network considered for the study is a multi -period three-echelon (processing plants -distributors-retailers) supply chain network. As the freshness of the dairy product controls the demand for the products, the selling price of the product is modeled as the function of the age (freshness) of the products. The model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and the objective of the model is to maximize the total supply chain benefit considering the limited shelf life of the product. Keywords dairy products, three-echelon supply chain, freshness-dependent price, location-inventory-vehicle loading strategy Introduction The dairy industry is an important component of the global food supply chain and generates significant economic benefits around the world. Based on the report of the International Farm Comparison Network, global milk production increased by 2.3% in 2019, reaching 843 million tons (FCN, 2015). The report also estimated that dairy products are expected to grow by 2% per year, owing to population growth, urbanization, and increased disposable income. Despite its enormous contributions to the global economy, the dairy supply chain network is confronted with a variety of issues that threaten its long-term profitability and resiliency. The dairy supply chain is a subclass of the global supply chain with distinct features and characteristics. The perishability of dairy products and limited shelf life make this supply chain different from all other non -perishable product supply chains. The chain is encompassed by a series of interconnected processes and components involved in the production, processing, distribution, and retailing of dairy products. Each of the processes and components plays a crucial role in ensuring the freshness and cost of the products from production to consumption. The dairy supply chain starts with the dairy farms which are the primary source of milk production. Breeding, raising dairy cows, managing their nutrition and health, and milking are performed in this section of the supply chain. The efficiency and quality  of the dairy product will significantly be impacted by this stage of the supply chain. The next stage of the dairy supply chain is the processing facilities. The facilities carry out various processes such as pasteurization, homogenization, separation, fe rmentation, etc. to transform the raw milk into various dairy products such as reduced-fat milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream from the collected milk.

64,DUAL-SOURCING STRATEGY FOR SPACE INDUSTRY PROJECTS,@gmail.com,"Order Splitting, Dual-Sourcing, Supply Chain Risk","Using risk-based analysis to consider supply chain disruptions and uncertainty and potential mitigation strategies in the early stages of space industry projects can avoid schedule delays and cost overruns and lead to successful project outcomes. Space industry projects, especially launch vehicles, are complicated assemblies of high -technology and specialized components. Components are engineered, procured, manufactured, and assembled for specific missions or projects; unlike make-to-stock manufacturing, assemblies are produced at a mass production rate for customers to choose off the shelf or lot, like automobiles. The supply chain for a space industry project is a large, complicated web where one disruption, especially for sole -sourced components, could ripple through the project, causing delays at multiple project milestones. This ripple effect can even cause the d elay or cancelation of the entire project unless project managers develop and employ risk mitigation strategies against supply chain disruption and uncertainty. The unpredictability of when delays and disruptions may occur makes managing these projects extremely difficult. One mitigation strategy to supply chain risk and uncertainty is implementing a dual or multi-supplier sourcing procurement strategy. This paper explores implementing a dual-sourcing procurement strategy for engineered-to-order or make-to- order batch production. Modeling and simulation are used to optimize the order split for multiple suppliers and show the impact of that strategy on the project success metrics of cost and schedule. Keywords Order Splitting, Dual-Sourcing, Supply Chain Risk Introduction Once the multi-sourcing procurement strategy has been assessed and decided upon in the procurement process, the optimal order split among suppliers must be determined to place orders. Modeling and simulation can be used to optimize the order sizes among multiple suppliers with uncertainty. This paper considers objectives based on the project management triangle's two sides: cost and schedule. The model seeks to minimize project cost and schedule deviation through multiple supply tiers and phases. The third side, quality, is not set as its objective but could be considered within the schedule objective as it may be quality issues causing uncertainty and delays. (Pollack et al., 2018) This paper uses a simulation case study to implement a multi-sourcing procurement strategy and split orders among multiple suppliers in a space industry project. Literature Review This literature review will discuss several relevant topics to this research to better understand the existing literature and its gaps. Make-to-Order Make-to-Order or Made-to-Order is a manufacturing strategy where a standardized product is produced only after it is ordered. This strategy allows for customization and reduced waste. An example of an MTO manufacturing strategy is airplane production. The airplane manufacturer produces the aircraft after receiving an order from the airline with specific specifications on capacity, luxury, and aesthetics.

65,OPTIMIZING THE INITIAL PROCESS IN A DOOR ASSEMBLY PLANT,@leomail.tamuc.edu,"Optimization, Manufacturing, Discrete event simulation","The goal of this study was to analyze the feasibility of implementing an automated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine to improve throughput as well as efficiency of the system. The proposed machine would allow the saw to focus on other types of parts such as frames, while the CNC machine would both cut and machine stiles for doors. With the  drastic size difference between the current CNC machine and the proposed system, a new facility layout will have to be developed using the CRAFT method to optimize the flow of the entire building. With the parameter changes of the proposed machine and proposed layout, the expected throughput of the stiles should increase from 160 stiles to above 200 stiles produced per day. Lean tools such as Poka -Yoke and optimization tools such as discrete simulation was also utilized to provide a base for the new system. Statistical methods such as conducting the Goodness-of-Fit test also allowed the justification of the time study data that was collected. Poka -Yoke was utilized to “Foolproof” the new system by automatin g cut lengths and discrete simulation software was used to compare the current state model with the improved state model. The Payback economic model was used to determine the feasibility of the proposed system by considering factors such as power consumption, labor costs, implementation costs, and the cost per piece. The successful implementation of the new machine is expected to provide significant benefits, including cost savings, increased overall throughput, and improved quality control. Keywords Optimization, Manufacturing, Discrete event simulation Introduction Automation is revolutionizing the way that manufacturing is ran, by providing a system with less human -induced error, lower labor costs, and room for possible expansion. Human error can be theoretically eliminated by using Poka- Yoke techniques. According to Hirano (1987), Poka-Yoke works on reducing the mental load on workers. This could allow workers to focus more closely on other tasks, such as quality inspection or improvement ideas. Automating some tasks for workers could allow an increase production ef ficiency while reducing the risk for musculoskeletal disease as well. This could decrease the financial risk that companies face in case of injury on the job. Labor costs are also reduced due to the machines lack of fatigue. Fatigue can cause humans to slow down, and mental load can cause fatigue as well, thus creating a high variation in process times from the beginning of the day to the end. This increase in production efficiency could result in expansion for the company as well. Implementing artificial intelligence opens a world of possibilities such as completing multiple tasks on one machine, thus reducing material handling, reducing space requirements, and increasing throughput. Lean manufacturing is the process of eliminating waste, which combined with automation, could create a near perfect process. Tools such as discrete event simulation (DES), the single minute die exchange method, value stream mapping, and facility planning techniques can be used in unison with automation to ensure maximum efficiency of a large investment such as automation. DES is a method that uses statistics in a simulation software to create stochastic models. From this, outside factors can be modeled and improvements can be found based off the model. SMED could prove extremely beneficial to automated systems that work in unison with humans. For facilities that have different parts with changing complexities, it could be beneficial to have part of the syste m running while another portion of the system would be shut down for tooling change overs. This drastically reduces changeover time. Value stream mapping (VSM) can be used to separate wasted time from non-value-added time. Reducing non-value-added time can increase production downstream by decreasing lead times. Using algorithms for facility planning can decrease the",leomail.tamuc.edu,,,46.3144754,11.0480288
66,ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS IN AIRPORTS,@purdue.edu,"Airports, Sustainability Planning, Airport Management, Airport Master Plan, Social Sustainability.","Sustainability has gained traction in all sectors globally. Experts have raised concerns about the sustainability of the air transportation systems given the continued growth in air travel and cargo transportation and its potential impacts on economies, co mmunities, and ecosystems. Sustainability is defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Three dimensions to sustainability are – economic, environmental, and social. Environmental and economic sustainability are relatively well known, social sustainability has not received the same attention. Social sustainability is about the well-being of the communities who may be affected by company operations – internally and externally.  Airports operate around communities. Airport management entities employ engineering managers for projects such as roadways, runways, terminals, landscaping, and other projects affecting the physical facilities and airport operations. Some airports have incorporated sustainability in airport master plans, while others plan ad hoc projects that add sustainability principles to traditional airport projects. Airport managers are faced with the challenge of selecting the right social sustainability projects that are cost effective and that have the greatest benefit to airport communities. Airport managers must assess the estimated impac ts of the social sustainability project before implementation.  This multiple case study gathered sustainability management plans from six airports and interviewed airport executives to compile a study of the tools and decision-making processes used to sele ct social sustainability projects. This study may be useful to engineering management seeking social sustainability benefits in airports and other industries. Keywords Airports, Sustainability Planning, Airport Management, Airport Master Plan, Social Sustainability. Introduction and Background Sustainability is an essential component of doing business in the 21st century. Section 3.4.13 of the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), A Guide to the Engineering Management Book of Knowledge (EMBOK) (Shah & Nowocin,  2018) underscores the importance of sustainability in businesse s. The concept of sustainability or sustainable development was first defined in the 1987 World Commission of Environment and Development (WCED) Report also known as Brundtland Report or Our Common Future as “…development that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (p. 2.1). Elkington (1994) conceived the idea of the triple bottom line of People, Planet and Profit, which has been interpreted as economic,  environment and social sustainability. The Brundtland Report  definition of sustainable development is the basis  for the many variations of sustainability used in different sectors today. In the airport s industry, Janić (2010) defined airport sustainability as “sustainability implies simultaneously increasing of the overall social-economic benefits and increasing at a slower rate, stagnating and/or diminishing of the negative impacts of these airports during the specified medium - to long-term period of time” (p.206) . Furthermore, the Economic, Operations, Natural Resources and Social (EONS) airport sustainability framework developed by the Airports Council- North America (ACI-NA) is widely adopted by airports in the United States and Canada (ACI-NA, 2017). Although the concept of sustainability has significantly affected the way businesses are conducted, there is no one universally accepted definition of sustainability, standards for reporting sustainability, or an evaluation system (Johnson, 2023). However, there are sustainability frame works and guidelines that are used across sectors to report on sustainability, and as guidance for businesses that want to practice sustainability.

67,A PREFERENCE-BASED OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR COURSE ASSIGNMENTS,@wmich.edu,"Preference-based course assignment, Evolutionary algorithm","A recurring dilemma for administrators in higher education is deciding on course assignments because of divergence in faculty’s preferences and expertise. This research proposes the preliminary step of a framework to optimize course assignments based on surveying faculty for their expressed rankings. This consists of asking faculty to give every course in the schedule a ranking bet ween 1 and 5, with 1 being least desirable and 5 being most desirable. The Evolutionary solution method in Excel Solver is then used to maximize the overall satisfaction level of the department’s faculty. This research provides the preliminary testing of the proposed optimization model. Keywords Preference-based course assignment, Evolutionary algorithm Introduction A taxing and time-consuming task for educational administrators each semester is assigning faculty to courses for the semester. This scheduling needs to meet the requirements of the university along with the needs of the students and faculty. In a higher e ducation environment, students have some flexibilities to generate their study plans for each semester. Conversely, this type of option does not exist for instructors. Instead, after courses have been determined, administrators must assign specific faculty  members to instruct the courses. It is reasonable that administrators will assign instructors to courses based on their academic background and preference in teaching the subject. There is also the dilemma that each faculty may be obligated to, for example, research activities, areas of expertise, and other service activities. Depending on the type and size of the educational institution, these schedules can become even more challenging. The task is complex as it carries both organizational and personal co nstraints. Therefore, administrators must take a great deal of factors into account when creating course assignments and schedules. Problem Statement and Literature Review As mentioned earlier, students have some flexibilities to pick and choose their own courses for each semester, but faculty do not. However, it is fair to say that both groups are directly impacted to a large degree by course scheduling. From the students’ perspective, when course offerings are not ideal, it can affect the number of classes they are able to take every semester and the ability to fulfill prerequisites which in turn can impact financial aid requirements and length of time before graduation, am ong other factors. Meanwhile, scheduling faculty poorly for courses can impact the quality of instruction, their satisfaction levels (both students and faculty members), and student retention in the course (Bellardo, 2010). When these factors are considered, course assignment easily grows cumbersome to manage. Operations research has been applied as one of the primary problem -solving methods. Ackoff (1962) states that “the purpose of operational research is to improve operations” (p.  10). The method aims to optimize the use of resources in operations. In other words, the objective of conducting operations research is always to either maximize profit or minimize costs. These resources, for a business or organization, include the number of labor hours or materials available for a product or service. Given the limit ation of these resources, they are usually referred to as the “constraints” of the problem. These constraints directly restrict the objective of the operations.

This study consists of analyzing power system failure and recovery patterns in a post - extreme event environment to determ ine relevant pattern characteristics relating to power system resilience in statistical terms.  Specifically, the methodology of this progressive study consists of (1) collecting and processing data from power system failures induced by natural disasters categorized by power companies, states, counties, and natural disaster occurrence, (2) developing failure and recovery curves for the collected data, (3) investigating and establishing a distribution model that correlates to the goodness of fit f or plotted curves best characterizing the system behavior for each extreme external occurrence, and (4) creating an algorithm for specifying the resilience of such engineered systems. This study will then explore the resultant algorithm in modeling and answering questions about the resiliency of power systems subjected to some extreme events first, opening extensions to other kinds of natural disasters in the future. Since modern society relies extensively on power systems to survive, this increased insight into power system resilience will provide better situational awareness for stakeholders during future decision -making discussions regarding power system construction. Keywords Resilience analysis, power systems, HILP, hurricanes. Introduction Background Power systems are  complex, interconnected networks of generation, transmission, distribution, control  and communication, which are one of the most essential elements of modern society (Dehghanian, Aslan, & Dehghanian, 2018). The associated infrastructure in the United States is particularly intricate, geographically dispersed, and connected to varied degrees . (Mukherjee, Nateghi, & Hastak, 2018) . This intricate  connection of power systems extends to necessities in day-to-day life that make their absence, even for a relatively brief period, quite detrimental in effect to the  national economies as a whole and down to the lives of every individual. (Kahnamouei, Bolandi, & Haghifam, 2017). In recent years, the impact of severe weather on power and electricity infrastructure globally became increasingly pronounced, particularly in the face of continuous climate changes. Studies typically think of events with such severity as hurricanes, heavy snowstorms, tornadoes and floods as high impact low probability (represented by HILP in this paper) (Kahnamouei, Bolandi, & Haghifam, 2017) . High impact low probability events such as hurricanes, storms, tornadoes etc. expose power systems to unprecedented and intense influences which can lead to below-optimal performance levels, blackouts, or even total shutdowns. Such blackouts and outages affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars of economic losses (Mukherjee, Nateghi, & Hastak, 2018). A typical example is the case of the state of Texas in February 2021 where a winter storm led to a blackout across the state , leaving 4.5 million homes and businesses without power for days (Yazdanie, 2023) and directly resulting in the death of 57 people across 25 counties. (King, et al., 2021). Though it has proven to be challenging  to design a power infrastructure that is dependable against known and expected threats , and which is  resilient against high -impact, low-probability disasters (Kahnamouei, Bolandi, & Haghifam, 2017), power systems are still expected to maintain a low likelihood of outages and remain online in the face of such influences.

69,EVALUATING SENSOR PLACEMENT VIA MACHINE LEARNING MODELS,@mst.edu,"Sensor placement, unsupervised machine learning, water level gauge sensors, deep learning","As more sophisticated approaches to analyzing datasets become available the importance of sensor placement for expensive sensors increases. Datasets generated by these sensors help engineering managers take appropriate action in the early phases of the decision-making process but must be placed where the data provides the most value. Among these high-cost sensors, water level gauge sensors are some of the most significant ones when it comes to flood hazard predictions, usually captured at stream gauge stations. The cost of installing these sensors has decreased over the last few decades, but they are still expensive enough to limit the number that can be placed. Pinpointing the best locations to place new sensors is still a challenge, as there are many other datasets that could influence the value of stream gauge information at a particular station. This study uses unsupervised learning techniques to evaluate sensor locations based on historical performance. The performance evaluation is conducted using unsup ervised machine learning (divisive clustering) and supervised machine learning (deep-learning) models. The information gathered from the results of this research can help future research to pinpoint the appropriate locations for new sensor placement to improve the overall predictive capabilities of deep-learning models. Keywords Sensor placement, unsupervised machine learning, water level gauge sensors, deep learning Introduction Urban flooding events can result in a cascade of detrimental consequences, including system malfunctions, property damage, traffic disruptions, economic losses, and loss of public life (Ashley & Ashley, 2008). To better implement mitigation plans it is crucial to develop sensor placement strategies that can detect flooding hotspots effectively and efficiently. Among the various measurements captured by stream gauge stations (e.g., gauge height, discharge, water temperature), gauge data stands out as the most valuable indicator (Castillo -Effen et al., 2004)  since the analysis of data collected from gauge height sensors can shed light on a wide spectrum of situations ranging from drought to flash floods antecedent to their occurrence. At its core, a gauge height sensor serves as an essential instrument for continuously monitoring the vertical distance between the surface of a body of water, such as a river or stream, and a reference point known as a gauge datum (Maidment, 1993). Gauge height holds immense significance, given its extensive use in computer models and forecasting, including flood inundation maps and flood forecasts.  The accuracy of these analytical and forecasting models hinges heavily on the precision of input data. Accordingly, while a decrease in the costs involved in sensor installation has facilitated the possibility of installing a greater number of sensors leading to more accurate data, indiscriminate placement of sensors in every candidate location is economically unsound. Moreover, additional sensors do not necessarily translate to improved flood pr edictability. Therefore, there arises a pressing need for a selective mechanism to identify ideal nodes among potential nodes for installing water level sensors effectively in hydrological networks. Literature Review Within the domain of water research, the problem of sensor placement was initially introduced with the aim of monitoring water quality and detecting contaminants in water distribution systems.

The aim of the current study is to understand the potential group differences in perceptions of efficiency as they relate to affordability based on organization size, highlighting areas in which organizational change may occur to reduce miscommunication, scheduling delays, and  process waste. In order to gather perspectives surrounding affordability, a survey was conducted with participants from The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Participants could be undergraduate or graduate students with the stipulation that they must currently be employed. Frequency counts of Likert ratings identified similar perceptions regarding organizational efficiency regardless of organization size, indicating an alignment of perceptions across small, medium, and large organizations. These similar perceptions indicated positive beliefs surrounding current communication, organization, and scheduling practices in addition to both positive and negative feelings surrounding industry responsiveness and process adaptability. These results may help inform organizations of potential impacts to efficiency perceptions given organizational size. Keywords Efficiency, organizational behaviors, organization size, affordability Introduction Perceptions of organizational behaviors  provided by employees can be used to understand beliefs surrounding organizational performance (Dess & Robinson Jr., 1984; Zaim, Tarim, & Ozgun, 2019). Perceptions may inform management of areas in which organizational development or change is needed  to align behaviors with desired organizational goals. In situations where affordability of projects or programs is of concern, employee perceptions of organizational behaviors impacting the overall affordability of the project or program can be taken into consideration. This allows for management to  gain an internal perspective across multiple levels of the organizational hierarchy  of potentially inefficient areas that may be costly for organizations. Inefficient organizational behaviors can be expensive for organizations, potentially impacting the affordability of the overall project or program. Efficiency -associated behaviors are behaviors that may impact how efficiently a work system or system of operation functions. An example of an efficiency -associated behavior is communication, where miscommunication can disturb organizational efficiency and clear communication contributes to organizational efficiency (Slijepčević et al., 2018). This paper aims to examine perceptions of efficiency-associated organizational behaviors given by organization members as they relate to affordability, particularly focusing on whether organization size plays a role in these perceptions. Background Various organizational processes have been associated with efficiency, indicating inefficient behaviors can be costly for organizations due to miscommunication (Grossman, 2011), schedule delays (Chidambaram, Narayanan, & Idrus, 2012), and process waste (Gay, 2022), among others.

Keywords Value-Focused Thinking, Decision Modeling, Green Energy Market Objectives Introduction The United States has committed itself to a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of decarbonizing its electricity grid by 2035. Experts have expressed concerns with this goal, as there are deficiencies in the green energy market that will prevent the US from meeting grid decarbonization goals (Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2022;Schumpeter, 2022). Technological advances, a reliable power system, and political intervention are just a few sectors which must be confronted domestically to create a well -versed market. Fortunately, collaboration with foreign nations can confront issues and respond to increasing green energy demand. In particular, the US and Chile have capabilities which can confront some of the critical vulnerabilities that their green energy markets face in reaching grid-decarbonization goals. The purpose of this strategic systems analysis and subsequent system dynamic model is to provide US investors with an understanding of how business with Chile can help to confront issues in its green energy market. This report provides a  value model that can be used when analyzing business partners, along with  a general analysis of the potential that Chile and the US have for collaboration.

Technologies often shift the pedagogical approach from classroom lecture to actively engaging lesson material in memorable ways . Yet, it is rare to find consistent, systemic approaches to its integration at the undergraduate classroom level . Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) systems represent increasingly accessible innovations that might change the efficacy of the educational system and individual course design. Virtual and augmented reality technology allows students to connect and create mental models of complex systems across multiple dimensions. Many academic disciplines are investigating the opportunities AR and VR technologies can provide their curriculums as a support tool or alternate means of teaching. While these modern technologies assume an innate role in experiential learning academic disciplines, their role in engineering management educational curriculums remains undefined across the fourteen ABET accredited ungraduated programs in the United States. The purpose of this paper is to review the current uses and educational benefits of AR and VR tools, as well as discuss how it can be more applicable in Engineering Management curriculum in the Department of Systems Engineer,  United States Military Academy at West Point. In addition, it will present a novel experimental design approach which could guide educators in determining where AR/VR could become most beneficial to the program. Keywords Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Engineering Management Pedagogy Introduction Innovative technology changes the scope and performance of human activity and professions daily. It has the potential to transform professional disciplines by enabling the expansion of multi -domain, omni channel capabilities. The Engineering Manager’s role is to leverage engineering, business and leadership domains to create value for an enterprise through the alignment and synchronization of fiscal, human, and technology resources. (Mesmer et al., 2023) Due to the interdisciplinary team and role that Engineering Managers hold, the need for training and understanding complexity of emerging technologies is increasingly important. In education, technology has not only provided students with a greater density curriculum but the opportunity to shift the traditional classroom lecture to active engagements with multi-dimensional lesson material. Virtual reality (VR) includes “computer generated simulations” which provide a “three -dimensional, fictitious environment” able to be interacted with using all five senses  (Bardi, 2022.) Augmented reality (AR) enhances this world’s reality to include “digitized visual elements, sound, or sensory features” (Hayes, 2022) . Traditionally, as digital technology expands, barriers between the digital and physical world humans interact with expand concurrently. Contrary to this, virtual and augmented reality allow users to supersede these barriers and connect the physical with the digital world. Leveraging this aspect, AR and VR technology provide additional technological innovations that can change the efficacy of the educational system and pedagogical application. A variety of academic disciplines have begun investigating how AR and VR technologies can support and alter their curriculums and means of teaching, manufacturing being one.

However, for companies to engage in such a cooperative endeavor, an incentive structure must exist that demonstrates potential benefits in t erms of cost efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. The proposed model will assume three companies as players combining respective shipments into a  single shipment denoting the  grand coalition and coalitions denoting individual shipments and shipments combined with one other player in a three - player game. The proposed model will allocate joint shipping costs among the three companies and assign carbon emissions to individual companies with the cost of coalitions being estimated using demonstrative shipment data. The allocation will satisfy properties of (1)  Completeness ensuring each participating player entirely pays collaborative shipping costs, (2) Rationality ensuring that by joining the grand coalition, players do not pay more than they would if they chose to be part of any smaller coalition of players and (3)  Marginality ensuring players are charged at least enough to cover their marginal costs and do not subsidize the cost of other players in the grand coalition. Using least core allocation, the savings of all coalitions participating in the grand coalition will be maximized. A sequence of LP models will be solved to maximize the savings of the least satisfied coalition in the lexicographical order such that the propensity for each coalition to disrupt the grand coalition is minimized. The proposed model will be compared against Shapley Value and Proportionality-based allocation results. Keywords Incentive structure, Collaborative shipping, least core, Grand coalition, LP model, Lexicographical order, Shapley value, proportionality, carbon emission, Allocation. Introduction As Companies strive to optimize their logistical operations to further generate profit by reducing costs there is an increasing recognition that by combining shipments the cost of transportation can be reduced , this also enhances the sustainability of logistics with fewer vehicles means lower emissions of harmful greenhouse gases which address both cost and emission reduction. The idea of combining shipments is known as collaborative shipping, but for companies to wo rk together an incentive structure must exist that generates potential benefits (a natural mechanism for collaboration). To collaborate there needs to exist a reason for coming together as shipping is complex hence , the proposed study showcases potential benefits in terms of cost efficiency and reduced carbon emission there by arising an incentive for cooperation. Today, enterprises cannot ignore the environmental issue in their business activities. The increasing government regulation and stronger public mandates of environmental accountability take this issue onto the enterprises' agenda (Xu, Pan, & Ballot , 2012) hence, why in this paper we address the critical challenges faced by industries, including rising operational costs, environmental regulations, and the need for sustainable logistics practices  specifically considering the largest source of emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the united state on land to be cars and trucks (congress budget office, 2022). In this context, the application of Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) offers a promising framework for designing a joint cost and emission -based incentive structure that foste rs cooperation as traditional approaches to allocation of cost management often overlook the interdependencies and synergies that arise  in collaborating fairly.

The literature review highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with traditional leadership development methods, including the need for exp eriential learning and the importance of context and feedback. VR offers the potential to address these challenges by providing realistic and immersive simulations that allow individuals to experience leadership situations and receive immediate feedback.  Overall, this study suggests that VR has the potential to be an effective tool for leadership development. However, the development of a successful VR leadership development program requires careful consideration of the specific needs and context of the or ganization, as well as a commitment to ongoing evaluation and improvement. Keywords Virtual reality, leadership, training, andragogy, technology Introduction Virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a transformative innovation with vast potential in various fields, including education, training, entertainment, and healthcare. By immersing users in digitally simulated environments, VR creates a realistic a nd interactive experience that engages multiple senses, thereby transporting individuals into virtual worlds that can be both captivating and instructive. As a result, VR has garnered significant attention and has become a subject of a growing body of research and exploration. The fundamental concept behind VR is to create an artificial environment that simulates the physical world or an imagined space, allowing users to interact with virtual objects and entities in real -time. Through the use of head - mounted displays (HMD), motion and eye-tracking sensors, and other input devices, users are provided with a sense of presence and agency within the virtual environment. This immersive and interactive nature of VR technology holds immense promise for revolutionizing various domains by  offering novel ways of experiencing and engaging with information. In recent years, VR has gained particular traction in areas such as training and education. Its ability to simulate real-world scenarios and provide hands-on experiences in a controlled and safe environment makes it a valuable tool for skill acquisition, learning, and development. VR-based training programs have been utilized in fields ranging from healthcare, leadership, and aviation to manufacturing and customer service, offering trainees opportunities to practice and refine their abilities without real-world consequences. While VR technology has made significant strides, there are still challenges to be addressed. These include technical limitations such as resolution, latency, and hardware costs, as well as concerns related to user comfort and potential side effects.

76,LEVERAGING BIG DATA TO INFLUENCE CUSTOMER LOYALTY IN THE PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY,@go.stcloudstate.edu,"Predictive analytics, big data, customer loyalty, operation management","Private transportation is a highly competitive industry, and companies face significant challenges in retaining customers. Providing cash incentives or multiple options does not always guarantee loyalty. Weather, distance, and duration of the ride are all external factors that can influence customer behavior. Thus, focusing on factors influencing customer loyalty can aid in optimizing operations. This pap er proposes a recommendation model that can predict customer behavior using big data. The model can help with decision -making while also lowering customer retention costs. The XG-Boost algorithm is used in the proposed system to analyze data from a variety  of attributes, including external factors such as car attributes and weather, as well as individual factors such as ride data and historical ratings to predict the ride rating. To personalize the experience, the model analyzes data over time to identify c ustomer preferences and behavior patterns. External factors such as rain, snow, or in the vicinity influence customer behavior, resulting in a lower ride rating. Such factors are used by the model to influence customer behavior. The model was created using data from an Austin -based private transportation company. The model can predict factors influencing customer ratings with 98.8% accuracy, according to the results. The output of the model can be used to make decisions such as which make/model to send, which color car to send, or if an external factor is a primary reason, which type of coupons to send, all of which will increase customer loyalty. Keywords Predictive analytics, big data, customer loyalty, operation management Introduction The private transportation industry is highly competitive and fast -paced, necessitating continuous efforts from companies to attract and retain customers. In this dynamic environment, customer loyalty emerges as a crucial factor for long-term success. Customer loyalty denotes the tendency of customers to consistently choose and use a company's products or services over an extended period. Various elements influence customer loyalty, including product/service quality, price, customer experience, and the company's reputation. Recently, big data has brought about a revolutionary transformation in the private transportation sector. By providing companies with unprecedented access to vast and complex datasets, sourced from sensors, social media platforms, and customer transactions, big data opens new possibilities to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. Through the power of big data analytics, companies can unlock actionable information that can significantly enhance the overall customer experience (Court et al., 2015). In the quest to improve customer loyalty, transportation companies are making strides towards leveraging historical transportation data alongside external and environmental factors surrounding each ride. The goal is to predict customers' feedback ratings, which are directly proportional to their mood during the ride. By including external factors like weather conditions, traffic congestion, and any unexpected events that may have influenced the customer's experience, companies can develop more accurate predictive models. This approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of the customer experience, as it considers not only the choices made by customers and post-ride surveys but also the impact of external factors on their mood during the ride. By analyzing this amalga mation of data, transportation companies can gain valuable insights into the driving factors behind customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Moreover, integrating external data into predictive analytics models allows companies to take a proactive approach in managing customer experiences.

For this reason, this research focused on the development of a Check -In Tool© to assess how employees or students are doing on a daily basis within a specific context. Additionally, an exploratory application of the Check-In Tool© was conducted during spring semester 2023 with students in a senior engineering capsto ne design course at Montana State University . With the utilization of Mentimeter, a software designed for interactive user feedback, students accessed a QR code and answered the question: “How are you doing today?” The purpose of this activity and the utilization of the Check -In Tool© was to analyze trends in student motivation, engagement, and mental health. Of the 4 0 registered students, 27 students on average accessed the Mentimeter survey each day and answered the prompts to rate how they were doing. Preliminary analysis of the survey data shows ongoing measurements of the general trends of student behavior over the semester as well as individual student highs and lows. This insight provides the foundation for future research and the development of metrics to evaluate academic systems, thereby gaining wisdom and engineering system responsiveness toward growth opportu nities and correcting divergent behaviors. While this research focuses on academic systems, it has broad application in engineering management to track employee satisfaction or burnout and trigger early intervention strategies. Keywords Responsive Systems, Check-In Tool©, Mentimeter, Feedback, Academic Systems Introduction Research on responsive systems varies widely in both field of study and application. Studies ranging from biological and biomedical systems (Lin et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2016) to chemical systems (Athanassiadis et al., 2022; Isaacs, 2014; Vlatković et al., 2016) , to construction and architectural structures and technologies (Beaman & Bader, 2010; Heidari Matin & Eydgahi, 2020) , to teaching and education systems (Dray & Wisneski, 2011; Hughes et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2020) to name only a few. While wide in the application and study of this topic, what brings the research on responsive systems under one theme, at a general systems level, is the desire to better understand the change of a system when it is introduced to new or changing stimuli. For the chemical or biological systems, the system responsiveness may be largely automatic and natural, whereas with the architectural or mechanical systems, this responsiveness is aided by the influence of ever evolving and sophisticated technologies (Warner et al., 1994). Teaching and education systems experience similar changes when introduced to new situations, such as curriculum changes, policy changes, administrative changes, or wider -scale political changes. However, rather than focusing on the response of academic systems to outside changes, this research considers the purposeful engineering of responsive and adaptive academic systems. Aligning with the work on adaptive educational systems by Shute and Zapata-Rivera (2012), this research considers the sequence of monitoring learner characteristics and making adjustments to better fit the needs of the learner. However, it deviates from the work of Shute and Zapata -Rivera (2012) in that it considers the engineering of communication driven responsive systems and the application of a fast and frequent feedback tool in the collection of ongoing stimuli from the learners (aka, the students) in the form of a daily Check-In Tool©. This research will discuss 1) the initial brainstorming and development of a daily Check-In Tool© in the Change and Reliable Systems Engineering and Management  (CaRSEM) lab at Oregon State University, 2) the exploratory application of the tool in a classroom setting at Montana State University, and 3) reflections on the tool and its",montana.edu,Montana State University - Bozeman,United States,45.6638859,-111.07928704602077

There is a slew of challenges that face these use cases, especially in training of personnel in highly technical fields. The application of XR in these training environments creates complex systems. These types of training systems create unique system behaviors, s ome of which are considered undesired. Simulator sickness (herein includes cyber sickness) is one behavior observed in users of such complex training systems. In this paper, the authors set an agenda for research to develop a characterization framework for representing these training systems that consider the physics -based, software-based, and human factors elements that will be used to define and evaluate these systems. To contextualize the research agenda, the authors will utilize a flight training use case for 14 CFR Part 141 (pilot schools). The authors anticipate that this representation will facilitate the inclusion of human factors in performance characterization of a VR-based complex training system, thereby enabling optimization to min imize undesired behaviors , standardized measurement to enable evidence -based organizational change, and performance measurement that can be used by implementers at academic institutions and industry practitioners. Keywords Virtual Reality, Complex Systems Design Introduction Commercial aviation was an $800 billion industry that shrunk to $300 billion in significant part due to the restrictions on travel and commerce in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic that was declared in March of 2020 (CDC, 2023; ICAO, 2023). The industry has experienced steady growth since but is now plagued with a pilot shortage (Forbes, 2023). In the US , there is a combination of an increased rate of retirement of senior pilots and a costly and time intensive commitment needed to train pilots that is resulting in the strained ability to restaff pilots at the needed rate. Although over 13,000 pilots were hired by U.S. major airlines in 2022, the projected supply-demand gap of pilots will reach 24,000 by 2026  (Forbes, 2023). In addition to this growing need, there is significant economic impact to other industries as well whose supply chains reply on  air transport. This highlights a need to improve the efficiency of training while maintaining the effectiveness that has played a part in maintaining commercial flight as the safest means of motorized transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA), as the oversight entity on pilot training certification, is responsible for certifying simulators that can be used for flight training , including logged flight hours (OFR, 2023). These systems, as they exist, are costly and are limited to specific aircraft types given their reliance on physical cockpit recreations. Several scholars have proposed the use of XR (extended reality, encompassing Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality technologies ) to augment flight training to improve access, efficiency and, effectiveness (Hight et al., 2022). These research studies follow rapid adoption of XR technologies for learning and training environments for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the arts, cultural heritage, medical practices, industrial operations , and emergency services (Bailey et al., 2017; Carrera et al., 2018; Ristor et al., 2023; Suh & Prophet, 2018). These training environments are relatively affordable and safe alternatives to traditional simulators  that utilize expensive equipment and require frequent, costly maintenance  (Torrence & Dressel, 2022) . Additionally, such programs are often customizable, offering  training materials and associated assessment opportunities for  personalized scenario-based, competency-based, and  part-task trainin g (Lekea et al., 2021).

However, there are unique challenges facing Hamilton County schools when it comes to economically disadvantaged students (EDS) and graduation rates. This research seeks to quantify the effect of interventions and their implementation specificall y in relation to EDS. It also examines if the number of EDS enrolled at a particular school had a direct impact on overall graduation rates for the 2021 graduating cohort. First, previous works on EDS and dropout rates were examined. There is plenty of relevant literature, but it became clear that there is contention among authors about the underlying reasons behind high dropout rates. Next, regression analysis was appli ed to analyze 2021 graduation data collected by Hamilton County on their official website for individual schools. Regression analysis of this data confirmed an earlier hypothesis but with interesting caveats. While higher numbers of EDS tend towards higher dropout rates at some schools and lower numbers tend to lower ove rall dropout rates at other schools, there is a lack of such correlation in schools where EDS enrollment numbers are between the two extremes. This led to a reevaluation of assumptions in favor of investigating if there is a ""threshold"" of students that ex ists at the upper and lower ends of the spectrum for enrollment in EDS or if the implementation of academic interventions differs significantly among schools. This requires further research, and a follow-up study is ongoing. Keywords Dropout Rates, Inferential Statistics, K-12 Education, Regression, Socioeconomics Introduction Education is an important indicator of lifetime earnings and has important implications for retirement outcomes. Additionally, a high school diploma is a standard requirement for most jobs and for higher education opportunities. The absence of a high school diploma can therefore lead to negative outcomes such as lower wages and poverty (Autor, 2014; Abdullah et al., 2015). On a bigger and global scale, deep educational crises such as equity, quality, and relevance have off-tracked the United Nations’ 2030 agenda, particularly access to quality education (United Nations, 2022).

This paper will discuss improving the standardization of medical supplies utilized at a large hospital system using Inventory Stratification. Specifically, this paper will focus on the application of inventory stratification towards Asset Inventory products used in Cath Lab departments across the large hospital system. A final Stratification Ranking was calculated per Asset Inventory Product reviewed through data analysis of product usage transaction data, purchase order data, expiration date transaction data, and determinations of Clinical Criticality Levels per Product . Based on these Inventory Stratification Rankings, recommendations were cr eated to first build structured Standards of Practice for the hospital system regarding Purchasing Decisions and Stocking Methodologies. In addition, these Stratification Rankings are an easily understood tool to assist the wider clinical staff when making purchase requisition requests. This process will push the hospital system towards higher efficiency in stocking practices. The future state of this project is to apply this technique to endoscopy, interventional radiology, surgical operating rooms, and outpatient surgical centers. The goal is to move the hospital system Supply Chain processes away from subjective and preference-driven product utilization decisions towards using objective data-driven criteria for making medical supply purchasing, stocking, and utilization decisions. Keywords Inventory stratification, health care, medical supply chain, asset management Introduction Business operational processes within the  Large Healthcare System (LHS) Supply Chain Management departments, at all of the different facilities, have developed alongside these clinical activities.  Each LHS Supply Chain department has risen to meet the challenge of the continuous demand required to fulfilling these critical and necessary inputs at each stage of the healthcare cycle.  However, any healthcare supply chain, just like at LHS, has added complexity and uniqueness to it that sets it apart from any  other industry. Most notable is finding a delicate balance between three broad conflicting drivers. These three drivers are finding a balance between enabling clinical staff to provide a service with good patient outcomes, by providing high-quality products at the right quantity and right time they are needed, while at the same time providing medical supplies in a fiscally responsible manner (O'Connor, 2018).  This complex situation is seen where the financial analysis of a medical product’s cost is balanced against an analysis of its clinical outcomes from usage in surgical procedures.  Decisions are made between alternative medical products which require not only a strong supply chain viewpoint but also an often overriding clinical viewpoint.  In this com plex balancing act, decisions of this sort can ultimately lead to justification for the usage of a higher-cost medical product instead of cheaper alternatives. The justification for the use of more expensive products is typically centered around providing a higher quality of patient care, resulting from improved clinical outcomes, and will possibly also lead to greater revenue levels.  Finding a difficult balance between these driving factors of lowered costs, higher quality, and good patient outcomes is what has driven this complexity and innovation in the healthcare supply chain.

Although there is literature examining user t rust and adoption of autonomous systems, there is a lack of literature focusing on how predispositions and personal subjective values affect individual design preferences for robotic systems that act as a counterpart in mission-critical environments. To better understand these preferences, structured interviews (N = 5) were conducted with several leading stakeholders. Responses revealed main preferences for themes regarding efficient quadrupedal autonomous robot designs, authoritative masculine voice communication, the desire for simulation training, and increased interaction with autonomous robots. Our findings expand on the current literature on stakeholder autonomous robot adoption by focusing on design preferences and provide further insight into how these personal subjective values influence stakeholder preferences. Keywords Stakeholders, preference formation, preference elicitation, autonomous robotic system, system design Introduction The interest in autonomous system utilization has been an increasing trend in modern society with consideration of implementation into the workforce to increase efficiency, reduce labor stress and risk to personnel, and maximize job performance and satisfa ction. The military sector plans to implement unmanned ground robots for surveillance reconnaissance, comprising ⅓ of their ground forces (Voth, 2004). While utilizing small, unmanned robots allows for more agility and safety in high-stress military situations, it can also result in the loss of life, financial loss from failure, or serious injury from system malfunction and system performance degradation. For ongoing military advancement, it is essential to understand how predispositions and personal subjec tive values affect individual design preferences toward a robotic counterpart, promoting trusting relationships to foster acceptance and adoption (Weger et al., 2022). The objective of this study was to interview various stakeholders regarding their preference for an autonomous robotic counterpart in mission -critical environments. This study utilized a structured interview design and applied qualitative inductive content analysis to examine stakeholder preferences for impl ementing a robotic counterpart. Gaining information on stakeholder preferences is imperative for technological advancement in autonomous robotic system design for mission-critical environments. Background Stakeholder Preference Formation and Elicitation Preferences are defined as existing values commonly constructed and elicited through context -dependent processes (Tversky & Thaler, 1990).

82,MODEL-BASED SYSTEM ENGINEERING ENABLED APPROACH FOR MANAGING INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN AFRICA,@up.ac.za,"MBSE, Document Centric, MBSE Framework, Construction Industry, Complex Building.","Infrastructure projects experience challenges due to inadequate documentation of engineering and management requirements, lack of coherence in stakeholder and system requirements, contractual issues, and misinterpretation of requirements, leading to poor quality of work and structural failure. The current practice of construction still relies on the traditional document-centric method to distribute and manage the data throughout the lifetime, despite the advent of Building Information Management (BIM)  and System Engineering (SE). The practice does not support the coordinated, incremental, and systematic description of project requirements, design specifications, and interactions that emerge from different stakeholders during building design. Adopting and applying  Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in the design and construction of complex buildings and civil infrastructure projects may significantly support systems integration, requirement management, verification, and configuration management as it addresses the information chaos introduced by the document -centric approach. This study analyses the practical application of the MBSE in the infrastructure construction industry by employing a mixed research method that combines quantitative and qualitative research data . The research has found no consistent and structured MBSE procedures and guidelines to support MBSE implementation in the construction industry. Hence, the research proposes an MBSE framework for the construction domain, which is the main product of this study.

Introduction and Background Information Most developing countries face many challenges in achieving comfortable living standards through accessibility to stable and affordable necessities, potable water, comfortable accommodation, and stable electricity (Dunmade & Fayomi, 2018). It is reported by Dunmade and Fayomi (2018) that most of the challenges above are escalated by poor infrastructure development in Africa. African governments have engaged in a progressive step in investing in large - scale infrastructure projects (Horvat et al., 2020). Investment in infrastructure development requires a large capital outlay (Horvat et al., 2020). Therefore, foreign capital investment has played a substantial role in developing African infrastructure and is the basis for implementing Agenda 2063 and 2030 (Horvat et al., 2020; Pack,1993). Dunmade & Fayomi (2018) also revealed that most African infrastructure is not affordable, easily accessible, and reliable due to frequent breakdowns and does not provide satisfactory services. The frequent breakdowns result from inadequate infrastructure maintenance, insufficient fund s, or unavailability of replacement parts, as well as  the variation in the service conditions of the infrastructure deployment country compared to the originating country. The vulnerability of the infrastructure is due to two significant factors; the first one is the poor design of the infrastructure with no rigorous comprehension of the impact of facilities on climate change. The second one is an oversight on how climate change may affect the functionality/operations as well as the life cycle of the asset. However, it is suggested that mitigating the factors in the subject hinges on the ability of engineers and stakeholders in the African region to develop or adopt a well -customized and collaborative systematic life cycle engineering approach to infra structure development (Dunmade & Fayomi 2018). The increased complexity of construction projects requires the involvement of a wide range of organization s throughout the project lifecycle – from conceptual planning to decommissioning. Coordinated information management must merge, co-manage, and semantically connect the information and artefacts generated throughout",up.ac.za,University of Pretoria,South Africa,-25.75433545,28.230857806174797
83,FORECASTING SUPPLY IN BLOOD BANK SUPPLY CHAIN,@astate.edu,"Blood Supply Chain, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Prediction","Human blood is a limited resource, but it serves a vital function in accidents and surgery procedures. However, due to a lack of blood supply in hospitals, doctors could not save patients on time. Despite the World Health Organization's efforts, there are still obstacles in controlling the blood supply chain, particularly whenever there is substantial demand for blood and insufficient supply and storage.  By successfully predicting the blood collection and supply, we can be able to lower the instability in the blood supply chain. Although several models have been applied to Blood Supply Chain, very few machine-learning studies have been conducted on predicting donors' readiness to donate. To fill this void, in this paper, we propose a Machine Learning model for estimating blood donors' readiness for blood donation. As a result, blood inventory management will be able to anticipate any kind of blood shortage by being able to predict blood supply. With that goal, a number of algorithms were applied to the model for predicting readiness in this study, including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, where Logistic Regression outperformed other algorithms in terms of performance. This prediction model will exert a positive impact on the first phase of the blood supply chain which is related to the forecast of blood supply. On the other hand, blood shortages can be reduced by improving the system. Moreover, the proposed model provides trustworthy and precise forecasts and will aid in reducing uncertainty in the blood supply chain. Keywords Blood Supply Chain, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Prediction Introduction With medical science and technology advancing, people can expect to live longer; however, according to Lau et al. (2013), as people live longer, they are more likely to develop chronic diseases and degenerative ailments, increasing the demand for blood and other blood products . Although some patients may not recover, medical care and blood transfusions can extend their lives (with some living close to average life expectancy) at the cost of heavy blood consumption. The practice of blood transfusions is crucial to modern medicine. According to Carson et al. (2012), 85 million blood transfusions are performed worldwide each year , translating to about three blood transfusions per second. Bonjour (2013) suggested an adequate blood supply is needed for this vast blood transfusion. Blood supply plays a significant role in many aspects of our lives. A greater flow of blood transports waste from the muscle back to the kidneys and provides fresh blood and oxygen to the body. Thus, an improved waste management system leads to faster recovery times, less soreness after exercise, and better tissue health in general. Because of these benefits, forecasting the blood supply chain is very crucial. In that case, intelligent healthcare systems can play a significant role. We can evaluate the bloo d supply chain's accuracy by forecasting the blood supply. However, improving the performance of blood supply chains remains a considerable challenge for global healthcare systems.",astate.edu,Arkansas State University,United States,35.8447472,-90.67262556246513
84,REVISITING THE R&D PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR DEFENSE R&D PROJECTS: AN AHP-BASED MULTI-CRITERIA METHODOLOGY SELECTION MODEL PROPOSAL,@itu.edu.tr,"Project Management Methodology, Defense Industry, Analytical Hierarchical Process, MCDM","Project management methodology selection is a crucial part of a project and directly or indirectly affects the project's success. The traditional, agile methodology, or hybrid project management (PM) methodologies have unique superior or challenging characteristics . At the same time,  none provide an absolute advantage that can apply to various industrial and technological contexts. On the other hand, the defense industry has been among the early adopters of contemporary project management, and there are still discussions on the adaptability of agile or hybrid approaches to the complex, large-scale, and multi-actor landscape of defense R&D projects. This study proposes a selection model for project management methodology in Defense Industry R&D projects, with a case study on a Turkish defense hardware producer. After a narrative of the defense industry, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision model for project management methodology selection is designed by critical success factors derived from the literature. The decision model presents these factors as selection crite ria and their importance levels and then explores  the performance of waterfall, agile and hybrid methodologies by each criterion. PM professionals from defense industry R&D units provided the scores by an expert survey . The findings revealed that hybrid methodology is the most appropriate option in many defense R&D projects by responding to the reliability and testing requirements, evolving technology, and business needs while sustaining customer collaboration. The study contributes to theory and practice by providing a criteri on set and a hierarchical factor structure tailored for the PM methodology selection in defense R&D projects. Keywords Project Management Methodology, Defense Industry, Analytical Hierarchical Process, MCDM Introduction The project management methodology should be chosen wisely because it is one of the most important criteria of project success (Fernandez & Fernandez, 2008). Project management methodology selection is a crucial part of a project and directly or indirectly affects the project's success. Charvat (2003) claims that no “one methodology fits all projects” exists, since each methodology has superior and weak sides. Besides, the project management methodology depends on the project specifications  and the industrial context in which e ach project is unique and needs different approaches (Cockburn, 2000). Although one of the first users of project management is the aerospace and defense industry (Kerzner, 2017), few studies have been made in the defense industry project management area. Cooke-Davies & Arzymanow (2003) investigates the project management maturity in six different industries and found that defense industry is struggling with a degree of project work, including the pervasiveness of project management culture. Paton & Andrew (2019) explored the role of the Project Management Office (PMO) in product lifecycle management in a case study in the defense industry, and they pointed out the project lifecycle m anagement interface gaps in defense . However, they did not mention the project management gaps. Tishler, Dvir, Shenhar & Lipovetsky (1996) and Abhyankar, Kumar, & Sidharth (2017) identified the critical success factors (CSF) in defense development projects . Still, they did not mention the critical factors in selecting the project management methodology. Most of the studies on defense industry projects are about critical success factors or project success; the project management methodology selection for defense industry projects, especially R&D projects, is not investigated. There are three primary project management approaches in literature; traditional methodology, agile methodology, and hybrid methodology. These approaches have various project management methodologies within,",itu.edu.tr,Istanbul Technical University,Turkey,41.10504645,29.02631139200003

While significant efforts are invested to improve the sustainability of U.S. built environment, the construction sector remains one of the largest resource consumers, energy users, and was te producers. This research contributes to furthering the body of knowledge on how to integrate the CE paradigm with existing building and construction ecology measures for i mproving the sustainability of the built environment in the U.S. in order to mitigate the ongoing climate crisis. Case studies have been created to investigate the status quo and potential opportunities of adopting CE within the construction ecology in ord er to enhance sustainability efforts. As the cutting edge, the sustainability rating systems issued by the U.S. Green Building Council and the International Living Future Institute are taken to represent theoretical achievements in construction sustainability; therefore, these rating systems are the focus of two case studies. The research questions are answered with a better understanding of sustainability and CE practices in the U.S. built environment during different proposed circular lifecycle stages. This research provides insights to different managers and decision makers for integrating CE paradigm into sustainability practices. Keywords Built environment, Circular Economy, Sustainability, Lifecycle engineering Introduction To mitigate the ongoing global warming to 1.5 ˚C target which was established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2018 report, greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions are desired to reduce significantly and be close to net -zero. As publicly recognized,  to achieve this target,  various sustainability efforts from different fields to significantly decrease GHG emissions across diverse industries , e.g., manufacturing, construction and bult environment, food services, logistics, are critical (Reslan, Last, Mathur, Morris, & Ferrero, 2022; Guerra & Leite, 2021). Due to increased environmental concerns from the public, the sustainability profile is becoming more important to the reputation and value of a company. Therefore, it is pressing for Engineering Managers (EMs) at different levels in various fields (including built environment) to understand, master, and implement various available methods and techniques for improving sustainability. Recently, the Circular Economy (CE) paradigm which intends to decouple economic development from resource consumption has been increasingly claimed as a new philosophy to deal with environmental problems. Basically, CE discourages the use of traditional linear business models and promotes the adoption of regenerative systems and processes ( Reslan, Last, Mathur, Morris, & Ferrero, 2022 ). CE can be implemented in both engineering and management fields for solving “waste creation, resource scarcity, and long-term economic advantages” (Reslan, Last, Mathur, Morris, & Ferrero, 2022; Nikolaou & Stefanakis, 2022). Based on its attributes and functions, CE can be a promising tool aiding in the enhancement of sustainability levels in various fields (Kumar, Sezersan, Garza-Reyes, Gonzalez, & AL-Shboul, 2019; Ghisellini, Cialani, & Ulgiati, 2016).

Engineering managers may give directives to their team to “improve affordability”, but if the team members have differing understandings of that directive, their actions could be misaligned with the original intent. This paper presents responses from a survey completed by 172 employees of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Participant s were questioned about what they would do if they were asked to improve the affordability of their current program. The responses were examined to address two research questions: 1) What actions are perceived to improve affordability? and 2) Can conflicti ng actions be observed from individuals within an organization? Addressing question 1, the responses were examined to observe common actions. Increasing risk acceptance, shortening timelines, and negotiating contractor relationships commonly appeared in re sponses. These results highlight the tradeoffs involved in improving a systems engineering -ility such as affordability. While tradeoffs may be necessary, responses were not always consistent on what actions to take to improve affordability. Addressing research question 2, the responses were examined to observe conflicting actions. Responses diff ered on suggesting investing more or less time and money in early design phases, speeding up or slowing down the development process, and increasing or decreasing o versight. The findings for these questions highlight the importance of engineering managers being mindful of how many actions, and potentially conflicting actions could be invoked by even simple statements such as “improve affordability”. Keywords -ilities, affordability, system design Introduction Several definitions for “affordability” can be found across engineering literature. While all definitions involve some notions of cost, many definitions consider affordability to additionally depend on performance or concepts of system benefit. At times, the inclusion of benefits is stated to be the key differentiation between cost and affordability (Boehm et al., 2013). A cheap system may not be considered affordable if it does not deliver “good performance” for that cost. While natural language definitions found in literature can be categorized and analyzed in a variety of different ways, no analysis of natural language definitions alone can ever assess how different these notions of affordability actually manifest in practice without some measurement of t he manifestations. Due to the inherent ambiguity in natural language statements, individuals could be choosing similar wordings for a definition despite having understandings of an -ility which manifest quite differently in practice, or vice versa. Examini ng actions may shed light on how affordability manifests in practice. This study takes a novel approach to collecting affordability definitions by focusing on the actions individuals state they would take to improve affordability, rather than collecting na tural language definitions.

It is important to improve engineering education, including engineering management education, continuously to equip students in the best possible way for their identity development.  Educators shape the personal and academic development of their students by creating a learning environment that fosters both educational goals and the formation of a professional identity.  Therefore, it is crucial to understand the underlying factors shaping identity. Culture is one factor that plays a critical part in shaping the identity of an individual and provides opportunities and challenges in an engineering education context.  A key opportunity is that different cultural backgrounds lead to a more diverse engineering workforce in general. Challenges include determining how to best educate students from different cultural backgrounds to form strong engineering identities, particularly given the limited understanding of the relationship between culture and identity development in the engineering education content.  Multiple pathways of identity development are possible, depending on the cultural limitations and opportunities in which the individual is formed.  The process of measuring culture is complex and defining the appropriate instruments and methods for the research context is of critical importance.  A narrative literature review is used for this paper to evaluate the lat est insights on culture and identity formation in general and focuses on tools to measure culture by analyzing different research streams. Keywords Engineering Identity, Engineering Identity Formation, Engineering Education and Cultural Influence on Engineering Identity Introduction Various disciplines , from chemical and electrical engineering to mechanical and civil engineering to industrial engineering, are encompassed by the different fields of engineering.  Two skills every engineer is classified by are their technical knowhow in general and their ability to solve problems.  However, it has been recognized that becoming an engineer is dependent on diverse cultural aspects  even though the perception of engineers is base d on a rather comparable skillset.  Previous experiences as well as personal values impact the workplace of an engineer tremendously.  It is crucial to understand and analyze engineering i dentity formation to better understand the characteristics of engineering identity to then better  define appropriate measures to improve engineering education overall.  Engineering identity formation describes the process by which a individual identifies themselves  as an engineer.  Several cultural factors shape engineering identity, such as ethnicity, education, family background, cultural norms and beliefs, personal experience and socialization.   However, Birukou (2009)  noted that because of the globalization culture is not “ bound to geographical area, race, or religion ” anymore, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on cultural sensitivity.  Further, globalization poses many challenges because different cultures interact with each other more frequently and boundaries between culture might get blurry.  Therefore, the “need of cultural-aware managers and professionals” has significantly increased over the past couple of years (Birukou et al., 2009).

88,USING STATISTICAL CONTROL TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING EXCHANGE RATE PREDICTIVE MODELS,@ttu.edu,"Exchange rates, Control charts, Statistical Process Control","Accurately predicting exchange rates is important for a wide range of stakeholders, from businesses to investors to policymakers, since it can be helpful for making informed decisions and managing risks in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Predicting exchange rates is a challenging task that requires understanding of a wide range of economic, political, and market factors, nevertheless, the prevailing view in the literature is that floating exchange rates are better approximated as random walks processes. Prediction models based on machine and statistical learning using economic fundamentals and time series models have been proposed and demonstrated to improve the random walk model. However, these models usually assume that the used predictor va riables and series are in statistical control which is not always true and needs to be accounted for during prediction modeling. This research proposes the addition of statistical control techniques as a method for improving statistical learning of the exi sting models. The main idea is to use control charts as model selectors in the presence of out -of-control variables. By incorporating control charts into the model, the aim is to identify changes in exchange rates that are beyond the expected range of values. The results obtained will serve as an exploratory analysis to deter mine whether statistical control approaches are helpful for improving exchange rate predictive models either in the magnitude or the direction of the forecast. By identifying patterns a nd anomalies in exchange rates, the model looks to help users make more accurate predictions and minimize risks associated with currency exchange. Keywords Exchange rates, Control charts, Statistical Process Control Introduction In today’s ever-growing globalized economy, making informed decisions regarding exchange rates plays a pivotal role in determining the competitiveness and profitability of international trade, investments, and financial transactions. In order to mitigate risks and capitalize opportunities, economic models to predict exchange rates have been developed, based on the use of economic fundamentals, i.e., primary characteristics and financial data necessary to determine the stability and health of an asset . Among the most i mportant models following this approach we can mention the flexible-price monetary (Frenkel-Bilson) model, the sticky -price monetary (Dornbusch-Frankel) model, and the Hooper-Morton model. However, a  commonly spread idea in economic modeling is that the prediction of exchange rates cannot be outperformed by models other than a single Random Walk Model (RWM), i.e., exchange rates follow a martingale, which implies that the best predictor for the conditional expected value of the next rate, given the past information, is equal to the most recent observation or: 𝐸(𝑋𝑛+1|𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑛) =  𝑋𝑛               (1) This idea became a seminal in exchange rates modeling and was denominated as the Meese- Rogoff puzzle (Meese & Rogoff, 1983a, 1983b) and has, since then generated mixed feelings in the economic research field.

An influx of ill -equipped healthcare infrastructure and an inadequate pool of healthcare professionals caused an influx of mortalities. People with underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular problems, hypertension, and asthma, could not receive adequate medical care due to the lack of planning and allocation of healthcare resources to high-risk patients. In tough times like these, being able to predict what kind of care level an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.

The key take of this paper is that agile tools and concepts can be applied based on needs in power plants to add significant value and meet the stakeholder's expectations. Keywords Phase, sprint, methodology, iteration. Introduction Agile methodology (Laoyan, 2022) is an approach to project management that sim plifies a project into more minor phases. After the completion of each phase, it is reviewed to determine any improvements that can be made in the subsequent phases. The agile methodology considers team collaboration more important when following processes, the customer's contribution over the contract negotiation, flexibility to change over having a fixed plan, and having well-developed software over documentation. It is focused on delivering val ue, incorporating flexibility, boosting effectiveness, simplifying work , enhancing excellence, promoting teamwork, and maintaining a suitable working pace. It is primarily used in software development. It comprises methods like scrum, crysta l, Kanban, extreme programming, feature-driven development, and dynamic systems development (Brush&Silverthone, 2019). This methodology is increasingly being adopted in other industries, including the construction industry, where its adoption has risen significantly over the past few years. In the construction industry, its use has risen by 86% since 2020(Demski, 2022). Despite its increased use in Construction and other fields apart from IT, few studies have been done to show its execution and implementation. This case study will therefore show how agile methodology was executed and implemented in the field of Power Plant Construction. Its objectives will be to explain what agile methodology is, how it is an improvement from the previous traditional methodologies, how it is used in the software industry, and finally, how it can be implemented in other fields, as in the example of the power plant construction in Pakistan. Research Methodology This study uses descriptive research methodology. It collects its data from secondary sources.

The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude, direction, and repeatability of bias. Two sets of line performance data gathered from a large automotive parts supplier were statistically analyzed for variances.  The two sets monitored two lines having two shifts each.  An aut omatic production monitor recorded all times with some details filled in electronically and the rest with some limited manual discretion.  The other was entered almost entirely by the line leaders.  When viewed as a whole, a paired t-test of the manual versus automatic results of overall equipment efficiency showed little variance and no  statistically significant results.  Paired t -tests of the individual line results showed a larger collection of data shifting more consistently with some statistically important findings.  The average of Line one shifted negatively and Line two shifted positively with p-values of 0.078 and 0.047 respectively.  A second series of tests on the quantity of good pieces produced each shift, a number that would be expected to be identical between the two systems, showed the same shifting with only slightly less statistical confidence.  This finding is important as it confirms that accuracy in manually gathered data is suspect.  The variance in direction of shift suggests that understanding the motivations for data adjustment will require deeper investigation and are not merely due to human nature. Keywords Bias, Manufacturing, Data, Productivity, Industry 4.0, Industrial Revolution, Line Performance Introduction A few years ago, Dan Ariely gave a TED talk on the truthfulness of people under different types of motivation.  The key takeaway understood from that talk was that when individuals do not consciously focus on being honest, the vast majority of people will adjust the information they  are communicating in a way that casts them in a more positive light.  This phenomenon is not usually carried out on a dramatic or egregious level, but is consistently done on a relatively small scale by nearly everyone.  This effect also appeared to be unaffected by the reward, but was strongly connected to what others around the individual were perceived as doing (Ariely, 2016).  In the manufacturing world, this path for communication is often through data.  In the early days of manufacturing, consistency and truth could be overseen by individuals with many years of experience and high levels of competence.  They could see what was hidden in the data and drove results in spite of data flaws as well as work to keep team members honest.  Those days are, for the most part, in the past.  Manufacturing productivity data is available in dramatically increasing detail and volume.

To resolve this issue, many studies have been conducted to compare the performance of AI and humans across various tasks. Among other AI technologies, ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has shown remarkable advancements in natural language processing, and has been extensively used in various applications. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature o n several experiments that have compared the performance of ChatGPT with that of human beings in various tasks and to explore the implications of these findings for engineering management fields and test ChatGPT on engineering management fields. The results of the literature review suggest that ChatGPT has achieved a significant level of human -like language processing, and in some cases has even surpassed human performance even though human performance remains superior in some areas. This study tested ChatGPT on engineering management fields using questions from EMBOK Guide and other sources at different levels. Its performance was impressive on some test questions but somewhat disappointing in some other questions. The results of these experiments have significant implications for engineering management fields. Understanding the strengths and limitations of AI technologies and humans can help engineering managers effectively work for their tasks.

Therefore, one student  who undertook an online Engineering Management & Leadership Theory and Application course at Rice University during the Fall 2022 semester was interviewed about her subject-object changes throughout the curse. Students during this course were introduced to concepts of the three- level of mental adult development: “Socialized mind,” “Self-authoring mind,” and “Self-transforming mind,” defined by Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey during module 7 of the course. Students were encouraged to address the concepts as frameworks for assessing case studies and their academic or professional experiences through assignments and class discussions. Then, Student A was asked to locate herself in the adult mental complexity stages during class. Initially, the student situated herself in the socialized -mind level recognizing that their behavior is meanly dictated by the environment and daily interactions with people (colleagues, classmates, instructors). She pointed out that gaining self- awareness of their current stage helped her take the necessary steps to advance in their professional path, recognizing what it was that subject becomes an object which able her to move to the next plateau by applying the concepts behind the adult development stages of adult mental complexity, and other frameworks learned during the course. Keywords Engineering and Leadership Management, Adult Mental Complexity, Subject -Object, Mental Complexity, Self- awareness, Socialized mind, Self-authoring mind, Self-transforming mind Introduction Formal education on Engineering Management and leadership has been a challenge incorporating theory and practical cases during into student formation. Robert Kegan has been working on psychology topics that connect the Evolving Self, Mental Complexity, and Adult Development Complexity since the 1980s. A significant part of his work involves analyzing cognitive responses that a person embodies throughout their lifespan and in the acquisition of self - awareness. The C onstructive-Development theory propose s the convergence of two themes defined by Robert Kegan: constructive theme (referred to as philosophy)  uses psychological thinking to internalize and recognize processes changing in adulthood, and the development theme (referred to as biology) which shifts and drives cognitive process becoming increasingly complex . Therefore, recognizing the internalization that moves from subject to object is the key to getting out of the rooting, disassociating oneself from being self-perceptions in order to have perceptions as an object of awareness and attention  (Stober & Grant, 2006). Kegan states that self-evolving occurs in a series of three plateaus; the Socialized mind, where individuals receive and/or attend to information while being sensitive to their surroundings in concordance with collective decision processes, having null or low participation in making decisions. The Self-authoring mind  represents a second plateau , describing  leaders who can drive their attention and the collective cognitive process by prioritizing urgent information over important information . Finally , the Self- transforming mind, the upper plateau that orchestrates a communion of the last two plateaus guides the leader to look",rice.edu,Rice University,United States,29.716791450000002,-95.40478113393792

The procurement system is an essential strategic tool that affects the business bottom line and thus forms an integral part of the strategic objectives of businesses and governments. Hence, g overnments around the world have used the public procurement system to enhance growth and improve the construction industry.This paper identifies the current procurement strategies adopted by construction procurement entities.  Also, examines the impact of inefficient outcomes on project performance in the construction indus try and further determines possible measures to improve procurement systems in construction cost and delivery.  A structured questionnaire with a five -point Likert-type scale and open -ended questions were used to determine the participants’ responses with regard to the identified factors from the reviewed literature. The method assists in a broader discussion of findings as different opinions are received from the respondents. The results of the questionnaires indicates that corruption, poor planning, inadequate planning and lining to budget and political interreference are the causes of inefficient outcomes in construction cost and delivery. The study also reveals that the effects of inefficient outcomes on project performance include loss of confidence from the public, stress on contractors, legal action and bankruptcy. Furthermore, the possible measures to improve procurement methods are found t o be ; proper project planning, consistent communication between the involved parties in a project, the use of appropriate construction methods and developing skills and knowledge. Keywords Procurement systems, construction industry, Project performance,cost, delivery. Introduction Tlomatsana, 2016 states that governments around the world have used the public procurement system to enhance growth and improve the construction industry. The procurement system is an essential strategic tool that affects the business bottom line and thus forms an int egral part of the strategic objectives of businesses and governments. Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) confirms that the construction industry plays a significant role in South Africa due to its favorable effects on economic (Thobane, 2019). Memon, Rahman, and Aziz (2012), report that a country's socioeconomic growth is heavily reliant on the construction industry, which provides critical infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, and schools, as well as other improved facilities. It also contri butes significantly to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, it is important that construction projects be completed successfully within time, budget, and quality expectations (Olawale and Sun, 2010). In addition to this, Olawale and Sun (2010) observe that construction, as a complex and time-driven industry, is constantly plagued by persistent issues like low quality and productivity, cost overrun, time overrun, construction waste, and others. Cost overruns had a significant impact on South African construction projects. When the infrastructure development upturns preceding the 2010 FIFA World Cup were followed by a global recession and depressed growth, the South African construction industry wa s negatively affected  (Khabisi, 2013) . The construction industry is frequently used by governments as a primary indicator of economic activity, not only to stimulate growth but also to aid economic recovery from recessions (Baloyi and Bekker, 2011). Accor ding to Ogunsanya (2018), construction procurement has recently become a source of concern and industry-wide attention due to its critical role in delivering the intended benefits to project stakeholders. However, when compared to other industries, the con struction industry has struggled to provide true value to its clients.

95,A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF AGENT-BASED MODELING AND POWER SYSTEM RESILIENCE,@uscupstate.edu,"Agent-based model, power grid, power system resilience, microgrid.","Previous blackouts and increasing number of natural disasters have highlighted the weakness of the interconnected power system, which is complicated, fragile, and vulnerable. In the context of the power grid as a critical infrastructure, resiliency has become ever more vital. One of the priorities identified by the United States government for achieving grid resilience is increasing system flexibility and robustness. This goal can be achieved by a transition to a smart electric grid that can resist , adapt and recover quickly from  both man-made and natural disasters. This preliminary paper presents a systematic review of the research on agent-based modeling of powers system resilience over the last decade to identify key trends, areas of focus of studies on the topic as well as areas that are not adequately studied. Results of this study can be used by researchers to identify current trends, identify gaps in the literature, and determine future research direction. Keywords Agent-based model, power grid, power system resilience, microgrid. Introduction Power system resilience involves the ability of a system to absorb, adapt, and quickly recover in the event of a disturbance or failure (Kemabonta & Mowry, 2012). There are increasing concerns about the ability of power systems to withstand a disturbance and to recover quickly from such an event. A key factor that affects power system resilience is natural disaster. For instance, in the United States, natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, freezing temperatures, heat waves and earthquakes cause long-duration outages with significant economic and societal impacts (Macmillan, Wilson, Baik, Carvallo, Dubey, & Holland, 2023). The number of power outages due to weather-related events is increasing (Campbell 2012). Between 2000 and 2016, 75% of power outages in the United States were caused by severe weather events (Bhattacharyya, Yoon, & Hastak, 2021). These  outages affect millions of people and cost the economy billions of dollars annually. In addition to concerns about disturbances caused by adverse weather and natural disasters, there are growing concerns about the susceptibility of grids in the face of cyber-attacks. These concerns about cyber-attacks are likely to increase as smart grids become widely adopted. Modeling can play a key role in examining resilience -related measures in the power system. Agent -based modeling (ABM), in particular, offer opportunities to assess and test power system resilience particularly when real world tests are too expensive or impossible (Brudermann et al., 2016). Using ABM, a power system can be modeled as a collection of agents with autonomous decisi on-making capabiliti es to examine possible behaviors and inefficiencies. Considering the above challenges facing the resilience of the power system, this  study aims to  provide a systematic review of agent-based modeling of power system resilience over a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021. This information can be used by researchers to identify current trends, identify gaps in the literature, and determine future research direction. Methodology In this study, academic papers  focused on agent -based modeling of power system resilience were reviewed to determine trends in the research.

96,APPLYING MULTI-LEVEL SYSTEMS DYNAMICS MODELING TO SUPPORT AN INTEGRATED MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE,@ucf.edu,"Integrated Resilience, Organizational Resilience, System Dynamics, Causal Loop Diagram.","Organizational resilience (OR) describes an organization’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and learn from disruptive events. While OR has received increasing attention in many areas of organizational science, there are still many knowledge gaps including a lack of commonly accepted constructs to assess resilience capabilities as well as relatively little focus on integrating related psychosocial, technical, and operational dimensions of resilience. Further, most empirical studies of OR do not account fo r the dynamic nature of building resilience capabilities over time. This research proposes a model of OR that integrates employee, leadership, team, infrastructure, operational, and strategic dimensions of resilience. In addition, a multi -level system dynamics approach is proposed to explore complex behaviors that affect organizations’ ability to become and remain resilient . This paper describes the development of an initial two -level casual loop diagram based on published  empirical evidence of the factors that affect the development of OR capabilities. The results of this study support development of strategies that managers can use to systematically improve OR and serve as a foundation for future research to develop a multi -level simulation model that can be used to quantitatively evaluate strategies for improving OR over time. Keywords Integrated Resilience, Organizational Resilience, System Dynamics, Causal Loop Diagram. Introduction It has long been acknowledged that contemporary organizations operate in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment (Bennett & Lemoine, 2014) . Recent events, such as the Covid -19 pandemic, have only reinforced this fact and increased focus toward organizational resilience (OR), that is, the ability of an organization to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to significant disruptions (ISO, 2017). While OR is crucial to organizational survival, organizations in critical industries (e.g., healthcare, education, and government) must  go beyond survival to rapidly adapt to ever -changing business environments while ensuring quality and continuity of services to fulfill their role in supporting a healthy society (Hollnagel & Braithwaite, 2019; Shaya et. al, 2022) . Disruptions in these contexts go beyond traditional studies of natural and man -made disasters to include changes in the social, political, and economic environments. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of modern societal structures, best practices to systematically drive improvement in OR are needed. While the concept of OR has been investigated in many areas of organizational science, much of the research is siloed with relatively few studies that integrate theories and insights across domains  (Linnenluecke, 2017; Raetze et. al, 2021). In addition, there are few examples of quantitative models that support the assessment or development of resilience capabilities. Although some researchers have attempted to define operational measures for resilience (Mallak & Yildiz, 2016; McManus et. al, 2007) , no com monly accepted approach currently exists. Meanwhile, organizations often face significant challenges managing change and risk (O’Neill, 2017), further complicating the",ucf.edu,University of Central Florida,United States,28.59899755,-81.19712501183949

Such domains include software development, product development, process development, and process imp rovement initiatives. The application of agile approaches requires that people comprehend agile values and principles and how to operationalize them in a particular context. Besides the knowledge about the fundamentals of agile, application greatly benefit s from individual and team experience, as teams are the unit of work and analysis in agile approaches. Hence, developing agile skills is no simple task, and an approach that accelerates this development would improve project results and the time to achieve them. This work aims to propose a team readiness analysis framework through a multicriteria approach, providing an understanding of the starting point of the teams and being a guide for the digital transformation strategy supported by organizational/corpo rate agility when it is carried out in stages and systematically. First, the paper reviews the literature in search of parameters to assess the team's readiness for agility. Next, a  multicriteria decision-making model is devised using a design science research approach to help target the upskilling of specific teams in certain aspects of agility across a set of initiatives spanning different dimensions and perspectives. The development of this model is aimed at applying the instrument to an engineering organization. Finally, a discussion is carried out on this model's usefulness, viability, usability, and generalization. Keywords Agile management, teamwork, team readiness, multicriteria decision-making. Introduction Organizational agility is critical for successful digital transformation in organizations (Al Nuaimi et al., 2022; Digital.AI, 2022; Imgrund et al., 2018; Overby et al., 2006). By adopting an agile mindset and culture, implementing agile methods, and promoting data analytics, companies can accelerate innovation, improve the customer experience, and drive revenue growth (Ciraco, 2019; McKinsey & Company, 2018; Tallon, 2019). Of the most common characteristics of a good strategy for digital transformation, we  can mention prototyping to facilitate the journey of adapting and detailing digitalization perspectives (Imgrund et al., 2018; Kaur, 2022; Doz, 2010; McKinsey & Company, 2018). Some companies have difficulties in structuring a good strategy and end up failing to develop the digital transformation process, which is why this is a topic that has been widely discussed today (Alwheeb et al., 2017; Bughin et al., 2018; Ciraco, 2019; Im grund et al., 2018). However, a common mistake made by these companies is the fact that most of them start the transformation based on the premise that teams are ready for this process without previously assessing whether teams qualify to start an agile tr ansformation (Alwheeb et al., 2017; Imgrund et al., 2018; Kotter, 2007). As a result, companies may fail in their process and abandon it even before it has the expected results, causing frustration in teams and wasting financial resources and time (Aziz et  al., 2012; Bughin et al., 2018; Ciraco, 2019; PMI, 2013; Susanto, 2008). The literature shows that when an agile transformation is carried out in evolutionary steps and systematically – using agility readiness criteria – the risks of failure can be mitigated (PMI, 2013). Determining a level of readiness for teams is not easy, as this assessment needs to consider multiple criteria.

Keywords Interdisciplinarity, Transnationality, Education Programs, Curricula Design, Transnational Education Networks Introduction Engineering Management is a transdisciplinary field that integrates technology, science, and management to plan, organize, and control complex technical systems and processes. It combines engineering and business competencies to ensure the efficient implem entation of technical projects (Lannes, 2001). The book ""Engineering Management: Challenges in the New Millennium"" by C. M. Chang and S. C. Liu (2005) further emphasizes its interdisciplinary nature and its vital role as a link between technology and management. In essence, engineering management efficiently manages complex technical systems from a management perspective.

99,A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO ANALYZING THE RESILIENCE OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS’ RESTORATION PROCESS,@marshall.edu,"Critical Infrastructure, Restoration, Agent-based Model, Project Management, System Thinking","The increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters have brought urgency to the research on critical infrastructure system restoration. Effective and efficient restoration of critical infrastructure services is crucial for getting life back to normal quickly after a disruption. Effective planning for post-disaster infrastructure restoration is crucial for minimizing economic losses and adverse social impacts. However, infrastructure restoration is a dynamic process due to the complex interactions among various stakeholders, such as restoration managers and field crews. To address these challenges, this research adopts a complex system approach based on the integration of systems engineering and project management to provide a holistic understanding of  the infrastructure restoration process. An agent-based model (ABM) was developed to study the complex restoration process and analyze the micro- and macro- level effectiveness of the integration of systems engineering and project management principles using an electricity infrastructure system as a case study. Three measures of effectiveness, i.e., cost, quality, and schedule were analyzed. The underlying assumption is that the optimum restoration system (i.e., minimum cost, maximum quality, fastest time to restore) depends on the restoration project design, and the optimum pr oject design depends on the nature of the system to be delivered. The outcome of this research can lead to a better understanding of the complex infrastructure restoration landscape in an uncertain environment. Keywords Critical Infrastructure, Restoration, Agent-based Model, Project Management, System Thinking Introduction Natural disasters have been occurring with increasing frequency and severity, posing substantial threats to the resilience of critical infrastructure systems worldwide (Panteli & Mancarella, 2015). The resulting damage to infrastructure and economies is si gnificant, with millions of people affected and direct economic losses exceeding trillions of dollars (Khalid & Ali, 2020). These disasters often disrupt or completely compromise essential services such as electricity, water supply, transportation, communication, and healthcare, exacerbating the challenges faced by affected communities. The significance of addressing infrastructure restoration challenges is underscored by the need to minimize societal disruption, economic losses, and the negative impact on public health and safety (Zhu et al., 2021). Moreover, the interconnected nature of infrastructure systems and their dependencies necessitates a comprehensive approach to ensure effective and efficient restoration. The restoration of critical infrastructure systems after a disaster is a complex and multifaceted process, further compounded by uncertainties in the post -disaster environment (Chowdhury et al., 2020). Existing literature on infrastructure restoration reco gnizes the complexities and interdependencies involved in the process (Rinaldi et al., 2001; Ouyang, 2014; Xu & Masys, 2016; Barker et al., 2017). These studies emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of interconnected systems to effectively address restoration challenges. However, a common limitation of current approaches is the lack of a comprehensive and scalable framework that can effectively address the diverse restoration challenges. In addition to the technical aspects, the need to incorporat e the perspectives and needs of the impacted communities is crucial for successful restoration decision-making. Fulfilling the requirements of the affected communities should be at the forefront of restoration efforts, as it not only contributes to their w ell-being but also enhances the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the restoration process (Sharma, 2021; Ingram et al., 2006).

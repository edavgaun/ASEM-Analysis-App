0,A Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy Model to Forecast the Soybean Complex  ,,,"The volatile and complex market of agricultural futures contracts creates difficulty in predicting future price movements. Many things affect commodity data, including weather, sentiment, supply, and demand. Hence, by its very nature, this data is non-linear. Charting and technical trading are used by brokers to find trends and movements in the market; however, trading using these strategies with uncertain situations can become risky. Moreover, technical and charting strategies tend to create signals to buy and sell in the market later, rather than sooner. Some commodity traders still feel as though computer generated trades can lead to greater losses compared to more  traditional methods. Thus, the purpose of this research is to use a hybrid neuro-fuzzy model to create predictive entry and exit trades in the soy market. Data from the CME soybean, soy oil, and soymeal futures markets will be used to show that computational intelligence methods are comparable, facilitating profitability in complex markets. ",
1,"Actionable Volatility, Real Option Values, and Recent Oil Price Changes ",,,"Financial and real option analysis rely on the correct use of volatility. Determining a financial option's volatility is not a problem because it is based on uncertainty in one variableprice, and it is projected into the future for a relatively short time. For real options, there are multiple methods to calculate volatility and there is no well-defined approach to the question of which sources of variability should be included, and for how long. Many applications use a volatility projection based on the projects life, which is incorrect when the concept of actionable volatility is applied. Actionable volatility recognizes that only some and not all uncertainty is resolved when a real option is exercised. Thus this approach limits what variables are included, and for how long, in determining the project volatility parameter.   Traditional real option pricing methods would have dramatically overpriced options in the oil and gas sector in the past few years. Real options methods have been accused of overpricing options, and inflated volatility is a primary reason. The use of actionable volatility methods limits the forecasting horizon, which limits the value of the real option. Recent oil and natural gas prices are used to demonstrate the problem of option pricing based on project life horizons rather than on resolved uncertainty horizons. The dramatic decrease in energy prices serves as another reminder that the adoption of complex mathematical models without fully understanding their underlying assumptions can lead to serious financial problems.

2,Project Portfolios and Financial Portfolio Theory,,,"When we teach project selection in our engineering economy courses, it is usually presented in the mode of valuation within a constrained budget. This often is based on ranking of an expected return or expected value. While this is a good place to start, it is not a complete picture of how project selection is actually or should be performed. Financial portfolio theory has clearly demonstrated that both expected return and risk need to be considered when choosing investments. Individual investments play a unique role only in their contribution to the overall investment portfolio, thus only systematic risk matters, not total risk. These financial portfolios are typically made up of stocks, bonds, money market funds, etc. The mathematical theory is well developed and there is adequate data for application. This paper addresses the extent to which financial portfolio theory can be extended to project portfolios. We find that project portfolios can be analyzed in strategic, marketing, financial, or project management contextswhere the portfolio emphasizes interactions and total performance of the entire set of projects. The multiple contexts present both challenges and the richness of multiple perspectives. In particular, the strategic, marketing, and financial perspectives focus on maximizing the firms long-term financial performance. While many of the calculations that are part of financial portfolio theory cannot be replicated for project portfolios, we assert that there are useful inferences for project selection in a portfolio context. While based on financial results, they also consider strategic and marketing perspectives.",
3,"Case Study: Design, Development and Launch of a new MS Systems Engineering Degree",,,"In September 2014 Drexel University launched a new MS Systems Engineering degree. This presentation is not about the curriculum, but rather the approach used in developing the curriculum.  We live in a high tech, complex world with aging stressed systems.  Long term policy makers suggest we have entered a new level of complexity and systems skills are critical tin helping engineers develop robust and sustainable systems in communication, defense, energy, healthcare transportation and others.  In order to meet the challenge, systems engineers with  formal education combined with practical experience are needed to address a multitude of problems requiring a systems engineering approach for solution. The approach of formal education in systems engineering has to provide students with skills that contain the following core, essential elements: Provide knowledge and expertise of the Systems Engineering Processes to integrate user needs, manage requirements, conduct technological evaluation and trade studies, build elaborate system architectures, assess risk and establish financial and schedule constraints Provide skills for systems engineering leaders to develop affordable systems in design and sustainability by addressing and solving issues across every facet of the systems engineering life cycle model from conceptual development, engineering development, deployment/execution and sustainability.  Include the involvement of academia, experienced industry leaders and participation of societies such as International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) and ASEM The presentation will address this approach to formal to develop skills required by todays systems engineers",
4,Engineering Analytics: Research into the Governance Structure Needed to Integrate the Dominant Design Methodologies ,,,"In the ASEM-IAC 2014, Cotter (2014) explored the current state of engineering design, identified the dominate approaches to engineering design, discussed potential contributions from the new field of data analytics to engineering design, and proposed an Engineering Analytics framework that integrates the dominate engineering design approaches and data analytics within a human-intelligence/machine-intelligence (HI-MI) design architecture..  This paper reports research into defining the systemic design governance needed to integrate the dominate engineering design approaches into an integrated design methodology architecture to guide HI-MI design.",
5,A Brief Review of Systems Engineering Programs and a Vision for the Future of Systems Engineering Education ,,,"A basic premise of academia and science is that knowledge is developed using information generated in the past.  As a result, academics is inherently flexible, able to adapt to new knowledge and theories.  In the last decade, Systems Engineering (SE) has seen a significant increase in the amount of knowledge and theories.  This recent wellspring of knowledge has been driven by government organizations, industry, academia, and inter-organizational groups such as the NASA SE Consortium involving multiple universities and NASA.  These groups, and recent workshops and conferences, have recognized the shortcomings of the traditional SE process and have begun examining a fundamental rethinking of the theoretical basis of SE.  Essentially the development of a science of SE is underway.  SE programs must remain flexible during this time to best serve the students, offering courses that teach the practices of today (recognizing their benefits and drawbacks) as well as the theories and tools that will drive the future.  The paper examines SE programs across the country in an effort to understand their similarities as well as the aspects that differentiate them.  The paper will offer a vision for the future of SE education that will incorporate discussions from the NASA SE Consortium which is led by faculty at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  The courses offered in the UAH SE program will be examined and multiple paths forward will be discussed.",
6,Evolution of structural complexity in projects,,,"Much of what a firm does is performed on a project basis: innovation, product launch, M&A, restructuring and market repositioning are just but few of the examples.  Projects follow the similar lifecycle process as firms do in their market. Projects are incubated, they grow, and they mature and decline.  During its lifecycle, the profile of the project and its structure change extensively while its complexity characteristics - both internal and external  evolve as well.  Complexity correlates well with non-deterministic behavior, non linearity, unpredictability and lack of control. This paper will examine the rise and fall of projects complexity along their lifecycle due to structural interactions within the project itself, the immediate portfolio and external stakeholders. Implications for project behavior related to stability, observability and control will be also be examined. The issues particular to the matrix structure, which is widely used for ensuring project execution and delivery, will be discussed in detail.",
7,Multi-Attribute Fuzzy Approach to Rank Construction Contractors ,,,"Contractor selection decision in construction related projects affects the overall success of any project; therefore, there is a need for quantitative methods to help stakeholders make better decisions about contractor selection. This study enhances the construction management profession by introducing a new contractor selection method that incorporates using a quantitative fuzzy-set method to assist in the contractor selection process by implementing multi-attribute decision-making. This research examines a contractor selection model called the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to help decision makers make a decision on contractor selection. The triangular fuzzy-set model is implemented to define the linguistic terms used to describe subjective judgment related attribute weight assessment and selection attributes rating. Uncertainties of multiattribute and the relative weights of these attributes are quantified using fuzzy method. This study models the evaluation process of a set of different attributes that contribute to contractors selection and the relative importance of these attributes using fuzzy membership functions. Linguistic terms are used to assess different attributes and their weights. The contractor selection model introduced in the study converts linguistic terms into membership functions using fuzzy logic. The decision-maker rates different contractors (up to 5 contractors) using linguistic terms, which are converted into membership functions that represent the degree to which decision-makers believe",
8,Project Management and Effective Communication: A Study of Linguistic Philosophy for Communication Competency ,,,"Communication, considered the foundation of an organization, plays one of the most important roles in project management. While the cause of unsatisfactory results and premature project termination can vary widely, studies show that on average one fifth fail due to communication ineffectiveness. As technologies evolve and outreach becomes more efficient, the question is whether communication effectiveness will simultaneously evolve to meet modern demand, or become less effective over time. In this paper, a conceptual framework to catalogue project communications from a system thinking perspective to break down and consider linguistic components that make the exchange of information effective, known as communication competence is presented. The analysis is conducted using two components of communication competency: 1) linguistic competency, regarded as the sounds, words, and sentence structures in a form that may be understood, and 2) sociolinguistic competency, the appropriateness of the exchange with respect to whom, what, when, where, and why. In addition to linguistic and sociolinguistic competency, the paper shall further evaluate two forms of communication exchange, personal face-to-face and virtual or telecommunication. In determining what aspects of communication are required in each form and improving those aspects less effective, it is assumed that the overall exchange of information may be optimized. Through the use of the state-of-the-art matrix analysis, components of communication processes will be identified and catalogued based on face-to-face versus virtual interaction characteristics. As a result, the conceptual framework for project communication to improve the effectiveness of communication within projects.",
9,Business Model to Supply Rural Electric Cooperatives with an Integrated Renewable Energy System ,,,"The United States has tremendous potential for harnessing different forms of renewable energy which could help eliminate our dependency on foreign oil.  The Great Plains alone could provide all the power our country could foreseeably need with just wind power.  But, in addition to wind, the Plains are an excellent resource for biofuel feedstocks such as native grasses, wheat, corn, wheat, oil producing crops and agricultural wastes due to the natural climate and abundant rainfall. This paper describes a business model to use local High Plains renewable resources to satisfy rural residential and industrial / agricultural power demand and also, to process fuels for local and export sales.  This model is based on the integrated solution producing syngas which can be stored and transported using the countrys current transportation infrastructure.  This solution has great potential for the nearly 300 Rural Electrification Associations (REAs) currently in the Great Plains which do not produce power.  Currently, the REAs typically purchase power from privately owned non-renewable type power plants such as coal or combined cycle.  The integrated solution provides an opportunity for REAs to utilize renewable energy which will reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and the loss of scarce water that is now used in cooling evaporation systems.",
10,Reducing Energy Consumption in Military Residential Homes,,,"The genesis for residential energy analysis is simple - West Point and nearly every other military installation need better assessment methods to rate the energy efficiency of its residential buildings.  Modeling the energy consumption of these residential homes is critical in determining the most economic energy upgrades with short payback periods. These energy models also allow improvements to be made on the current utility billing program, which incentivizes residents in military housing to reduce their energy consumption.  This presentation uses West Points residential homes as a case study to show a systematic approach that can be used to move towards large reductions in annual energy bills.  West Point is using the process of modeling the energy fitness levels of their homes for energy assessments, economic energy upgrade selection, quality assurance, and creative utility billing incentives for people who do not pay for their own energy usage. Ideally, the systematic process prototyped in this case study will be used by installations around the military, resulting in a significant amount of savings.",
11,Towards a Comprehensive Impact Assessment Model: Power Outage ,,,"The electricity grid is one of sixteen critical infrastructure systems designated by the United States Department of Homeland Security. Grid reliability and resilience are vital to security. However, the impact of large scale power outages is often limited to short term economic impacts. There is little identification, or synthesis of factors that determine impact severity. There is a need for a more complete impact assessment model that, allows assessment of economic and social impacts of power outages beyond the event. This paper presents a review of the literature in the area of power outages and synthesizes relevant information for the development of a preliminary power outage impact assessment model. A comprehensive impact assessment model can provide decision support information for prevention of, or impact reduction during, power system failures.",
12,An Implementation of Lean Principles to the Loan Closing Process in California ,,,"In todays dynamic business environment, being competitive and eliminating waste can make a difference between success and failure. One of the ways in which a reduction of waste can be achieved is by implementing lean principles. This can be done in both manufacturing as well as in the service industry. Real estate sales in CA totaled about $173 Billion in 2014 and is expected to be around $193 Billion in 2015. The majority of real estate sales, involves the buyer taking a mortgage which is paid over a period of 15, 20 or 30 years.  A mortgage loan, also referred to as a mortgage, is used by real estate buyers to raise money to buy the property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose. The loan is ""secured"" on the borrower's property. Thus obtaining the loan is a significant step in the real estate transaction going through successfully.   The Loan Closing Process is the final step in obtaining the loan in order for the real estate transaction to go through successfully. However, there is significant room for improvement in the loan closing process. In this paper, the authors have talked about the loan closing process, identified value added and non-value added steps as well as made recommendations on how the loan closing process can be improved in California.",
13,Integrating Lean Management to Breast Cancer Center: Case Study in Turkey ,,,"In recent years the financial crisis has forced all the private and public companies to reduce costs as long as most of them had to lay off  many workers, or eventually dismiss them. Lean is a learning system which encourages staff to perform better in technical operation which in turn, increases process performance; so, it improves safety, quality and staff morale reducing costs, all at the same time, revealing new opportunities to improve effectiveness.  This paper focuses initially on a general description on the most adopted lean tools and practices, and the transformation process, through a systematic literature review and analysis of the various waste in the system, followed by a research on the most successful lean implementations in hospitals. Subsequently, a deeper analysis in the Health Care system in Turkey: Lean Thinking has been studied in the Breast Cancer Center of Istanbul. An initial map of the current patient flow situation was drawn, with the process view where the care is seen as the outcome of a sequential series of steps, from the initial registration of the patient to the discharge. Through the application of some Lean tools, adapted from the Manufacturing to the Health Care system, little but consistent changes are proposed, aiming to minimize the waiting time of the patient, improve safety and reduce the congestion of the bottlenecks of the process, such as operating rooms or specific machineries.

14,State-of-the-Art Review of Lean Product Development Practices and Their Impact on Project Success ,,,"The literature identifies numerous factors that impact the success of traditional product development projects. However, within the relatively nascent field of lean product development (LPD), product development success factors are less clear. The literature has primarily focused on developing and describing LPD practices, benefits, and methodologies, but there is a need for an understanding of how these practices impact project success. This paper provides a state-of-the-art matrix analysis of the past 30 years of literature to identify common LPD practices. Additionally, the paper maps LPD success factors to traditional product development success factors to develop further understanding of the benefits of LPD. The findings are useful for researchers and industry professionals employing LPD to improve project success.",
15,Impact of Organization Structure in A Value-Based Systems Engineering Framework ,,,"The design of Large-Scale Complex Engineered Systems (LSCESs), in a System Engineering (SE) framework, generally requires multiple organizations, each with numerous teams that must interact to realize the system. The organizational structures ultimately dictate the nature of the interactions that enable this realization and therefore significantly impact the final system design. The authors recent research using Value-Drive Design (VDD) and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) has demonstrated the potential of a preference-driven SE approach that captures critical physical and modeling interactions. This research recently added Organization Design (OD) elements to demonstrate the additional impact of individual and team interactions on the final system. In this paper, critical organization attributes associated with specialization and coordination will be added to the more traditional product-based VDD attributes (e.g. performance, revenue, product cost, etc.). A commercial satellite system (satellite, launch vehicle, and ground station) will be used as a test-bed. The goal of this paper will be to include both product and process attributes in a VDD formulation. We will demonstrate that incorporating costs associated with both coordination and specialization tasks in the value function will result in vastly different final systems than an approach that does not include these OD attributes. Additionally, the proposed paper will investigate the impacts on system value due to change in organization structure when uncertainties are present in the information being passed between teams. The main idea is to identify the impact of organization structures on the design of LSCESs in order to improve the SE process. ",
16,"The Use of Multiple Project Managment Strategies, Project Type Tracks, Scaffolding and Websites in a Large and Multi-Disciplinary Capstone Design Course ",,,"Management of multiple concurrent projects in academic settings requires a special management structure. In this paper, the authors present the methodology used to manage the Capstone Design course at the School of Mechanical, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. The course runs with a large multidisciplinary environment and a wide variety of projects. The class is divided into two sections: general and the SAE competition section. The focus of this paper is the general section where at least 40 different capstone projects are run in a given academic year, with projects ranging between industry-based, research-based, and student competition-based. These models include the design of both products and processes. To manage such a large, multi-disciplinary course, and to ensure that course expectations are communicated clearly to students, the three management strategies are employed: (1) standardized tracks to accommodate three distinctly different project types  product, process and student competition; (2) a milestone-based project completion process; and (3) a custom-built web-based tool that facilitates communication and information flow between team members, project advisors and sponsors, and course instructors. In this paper, the authors will describe and explain these multiple project management strategies to accommodate varied and multi-disciplinary projects in one course.  The paper has the purpose to initiate a discussion on how to incorporate engineering management techniques into Capstone design courses, learn from those experiences, and then bring the lessons learned into professional settings.",
17,A Novel Approach to Measure Development in Complex Socio-Economic Systems: Application to the Development of SMEs,,,"Socio-economic systems are complex systems involving society and are comprised of individuals and nations, large Multi-National Companies (MNCs), Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and governments. Each of these entities within the socio-economic framework interacts with each other. Each of these entities is also affected by other factors. In todays world, some of the most pressing factors for MNCs, SMEs, and governments are the increasing impact of internationalization; practice of lean management for competitive advantage; necessity to be economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable; and changes in government and corporate policy due to evolution of technology and societal expectations. These factors can prove to be advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on how each factor interacts and affect the development of each of the entities. For this reason, these interactions may be considered through the lens of a fluid mechanics system. The interactions may cause congruence or turbulence, where congruence positively reinforces the system. Quantifying and predicting the amount of congruence or turbulence will help in measuring the development of each of these systems. This paper will introduce a basic framework for quantifying development and apply it specifically to the case of SMEs.",
18,Collaboration in Integrated Project Delivery: The effect of trust based on the perspective of social capital ,,,"In Integrated project delivery (IPD), collaboration is the key criterial to measure its success and it is influenced by partners trust. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between trust and collaboration. In order to quantify trust mechanism, we adopt a novel perspective---social capital. From this perspective, we divide trust into four dimensions---performance, permeability, relationship bonding and system-based trust. With data collected from questionnaires that were sent to scholars and firms managers, the relationship is tested and verified by structural equation model. This result indicates that trust is positive associated with collaboration. The finding of this study perfects collaboration theory and provides suggestion for IPD project management practice.",
19,Balancing the Global View with the Relevant Few in Project Management ,,,"The current environment is characterized by projects of growing complexity. In general, there are more stakeholders to be considered, and they do not necessarily have more requirements, but their requirements are definitely more demanding. The project goals need to be achieved with frequently limited resources, whether human, material and/or financial. This poses a formidable challenge to project managers, who need to have the global view, that is, to understand what is to be achieved, and how. But having such holistic view is far from being sufficient. It is also necessary for the project manager to know what the relevant few aspects are. The typical project planning techniques, such as Gantt charts and PERT or CPM diagrams, focus excessively on time and/or on task sequencing, giving the project manager very little visibility of many critical issues required for an effective and efficient management of the project. This paper shows how the tasks in the project Work Breakdown Structure should be scrutinized, at the beginning of a project, in order to identify which ones are those relevant few, from five key perspectives: performance; cost; required and available assets; external dependencies; and demanded skills. The identification of these five subsets of relevant few tasks, among which there could be significant overlaps, will help the project manager achieve the goals in an effective and efficient manner. Balancing the global view and the relevant few allows the managing of projects with a systems approach. ",
20,"Standards, Bodies of Knowledge, and Certifications in Engineering Management, Project Management, and Systems Engineering",,,"Standards, Bodies of Knowledge, and Certifications help define a profession and delineate its boundaries. They can be observed in many traditional professions such as accounting, engineering, law, and medicine. Standards are the foundations on which certifications are built. They identify the current body of knowledge, in which professionals need to demonstrate mastery to achieve the relevant certification. The project management profession has been very active in developing and updating its standards and Body of Knowledge since the 1970s. A great deal of convergence and leadership have emerged and the number of professionals certified by the Project Management Institute (PMI)® and others has soared dramatically since the 1980s. Engineering Management standards have been developed by the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM)® and others and have led to certifications in Engineering Management. A recent review in the Engineering Management Journal by Remer and Ross (2014) focused on certifications in Engineering Management and Project Management. We extend this analysis to include the allied field of Systems Engineering. The development of Systems Engineering standards have been progressing at a more divergent, gradual pace and there has been less agreement on its body of knowledge. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)® has developed a Systems Engineering Handbook and multi-level certifications. We compare the progress in standards and certifications in these professions and describe the experiences in the project management profession. We suggest promising practices for enhancing standards and certifications in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, with the objective of strengthening all three professions.",
21,Integrating Emotional Intelligence into Engineering Management,,,"Numerous initiatives, including President Obamas proposed 2015 budget, have led to an increase in P-12 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs.  Projected increased percentages of STEM jobs have increased STEM programs in secondary education.  Students enrolled in P-12 STEM programs typically select STEM programs for their secondary education.  Recent research indicates a higher occurrence of individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in STEM programs versus traditional P-12 and secondary education programs.  One criteria for diagnosing ASD is persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts.  Overwhelmingly, students with ASDs enrolled in STEM programs fall in the Level 1 category, previously referred to as high-functioning autism or Aspergers.  The lack of appropriate social skills, or Emotional Intelligence (EI), is a hallmark of individuals on this end of the autism spectrum.  This lack of EI is frequently an impediment to effective engineering management.  EI includes a wide range of skills such as leadership, management, motivation, empathy and effective communication.  EI is not a substitute for, but rather an enhancer of technical skills and employment opportunities.  This presentation will discuss how EI should be woven into all graduate level Engineering Management courses.  Some basic recommendations will be made in this presentation as to how EI skills can be effectively incorporated into college Engineering Management curricula.  Implementation of these recommendations would empower those autistic students - as well as all other STEM students who would benefit from the same leadership skill sets the EI would provide them.",
22,A Model for the Evaluation of Environmental Impact Indicators for a Sustainable Maritime Transportation System,,,"Although shipping is the most efficient mean for transporting large quantities of freight over significant distances and at low costs, it is also responsible for the emission of 1 billion tons of CO2 each year, along with other environmental and societal impacts. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), shipping accounted for 3.3 per cent of global emissions in 2007, and it is estimated that these emissions will increase 200-300 per cent by 2050. Despite the evidence that environmental impacts are a concern with maritime transportation systems (MTS), there are no models that take a system view to evaluate the environmental aspect of sustainability. The current literature identifies the key environmental impact indicators that exist within the transportation system and models maritime capacity, but largely ignores sustainability. This paper develops a model that will quantify the environmental impact indicators and understand the interdependencies between the various elements within the MTS. The model will provide environmental policy-makers with an analytical tool that can help them evaluate the tradeoffs of the system and identify possible alternatives to mitigate the detrimental effects of these environmental impact indicators.",
23,A Conceptual Risk Tool for Analysis of Climate Change Impacts on an Island Nations Critical Infrastructure ,,,"Predicting the Worlds future natural hazards from climate change may seem impossible, but it has gained a lot of effort and attention. Forecasting the scale and risk of critical infrastructure damage from potential natural hazards, resulting from climate change, is a critical undertaking. This paper is a continuation of our research which seeks to adopt the framework of the World Risk Index Report to the Philippines. According to the 2014 World Risk Index Report, the Philippines has moved up in rankings from the third most at risk nation to the second most at risk nation of being a victim of an extreme natural disaster. This paper will be the support matter to develop a conceptual tool that could support and improve decision making. The conceptual tool will adopt the frame work of the World Risk Index Reports scoring entities using simulated inputs specific to the regions of the Philippines and will yield calculated outputs for critical infrastructure decisions. These outputs for decision making could influence: improved contingency planning, micro-insurance coverage, current infrastructure re-evaluation, future infrastructure development, and resource allocation that incorporates risk interdependencies between the regions of the Philippines. The ultimate vision of the conceptual tool would be to gain support and awareness for future studies of real data gatherings for practical use and planning.",

27,A Multi Criteria Decision Analysis Approach to Risk Prioritization for System Acquisition and Development,,,"Abstract Risk management, especially risk prioritization is a very important Systems Engineering activity. However, all too often this function is neglected during the system acquisition and development process. Today risk matrices are the most popular tools used in the risk prioritization process. They are widely used both in the private sector and by government agencies to categorize and rank risks. Despite their popularity, risk matrices have major flaws.  When project risks are not well prioritized resources are spent to mitigate or eliminate risks that are less probable or less impactful to the success of the project, resulting in projects going over budget or delivered late and in some extreme cases project cancellation. Knowing the major risks to a project along with their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact will help project leaders make informed decisions on how to use project resources to either mitigate or eliminate a risk or in some cases simply accept the risk. In this study Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) will be used to create a framework for project risk prioritization. Case studies will be presented using projects in three different domains to validate the framework. Multiple MCDA methods will be employed. Risk rankings from the different methods will be compared and analyzed. From that exercise and from analysis of the data, recommendations will be made as to which MCDA method is more appropriate depending on the characteristics of the data.",
28,A System Maturity Metric from An Operational Perspective,,,"Technology Readiness Level (TRL) has been used by NASA to identify the maturity of a particular technology and to compare with other technologies since 1980s. The approach has been adopted by many other government agencies such as Department of Defense and commercial entities as well. The widely use of TRL approach also triggered efforts to develop a similar metric to define the maturity of a system that is comprised of several technologies with varying TRLs. Currently available approaches address the system maturity either from a technical perspective or a cost perspective. In this paper, an approach is proposed to define system level maturity from an operational perspective by using the Functional Dependency Network Analysis. ",
29,Statistical Engineering: A Causal-Stochastic Modeling Research Update ,,,"In the ASEM-IAC 2012, Cotter (2012) summarized prior works that led to the proposal for statistical engineering, identified the gaps in knowledge that statistical engineering needs to address, explored additional gaps in knowledge not addressed in the prior works, set forth a working definition of and body of knowledge for statistical engineering, and set forth proposals of potential systems contributions the Engineering Management profession could make toward the development of statistical engineering.  In 2014, the ASQ Statistics Division, DOT&E, NASA, and IDA co-sponsored a Statistical Engineering Agreement to jointly research development of the discipline of statistical engineering.  A key gap in knowledge that must be addressed to realize Statistical Engineering as a discipline is integration of engineering specific deterministic causal models within stochastic models to provide additional knowledge of the risk of variance from expected response.  The statistics community has continued to frame statistical engineering within the context of the general linear model (GLM).  However, incorporating deterministic engineering causal models within the GLM framework leaves missing links of conditional dependencies, yields models that are difficult to fit or that may not converge to a unique solution, and may not increase the understanding of physical causal processes in dynamic stochastic systems.  This paper updates research into integrating deterministic engineering models as system dynamic causal components of Bayesian causal networks within a state-space framework to model joint causal-stochastic dynamic effects.",
30,A State of the Art Matrix Analysis on Multi-Project Management in Capstone Senior Design Courses ,,,"Multi-Project management can be challenging for organizations.  The complexity of this task increases considerably when dealing with a large variety of project types.  The school of Mechanical Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering (MIME) at Oregon State University (OSU) teaches a Capstone Senior Design Course aimed at preparing students for real world engineering problem solving through group collaboration.  In each class, there are approximately forty groups of three undergraduate engineers that work together and use engineering concepts to create processes and products.  The goal of these projects range from building a rocket to implementing lean tools.  The instructor, in charge of the course, manages all of these teams using a newly implemented website tool.  In order to improve this tool, and the class as a whole, the State-of-the-Art Matrix Analysis methodology will be used to break down, analyze and compare historical and modern ideas and practices of capstone classroom management.  This study will place special attention on literature containing classrooms with a large variety of projects as well as current technologies and the methods with which they are utilized.

In turn, this data is converted to information which can be used in a timely fashion by decision makers.  Typically these ""Enterprise Information Systems"" are driven by basic return on investment decisions and are an organizational imperative, necessary to compete in the global economy.  On the other hand, professional societies and non-profits have the same general needs as business enterprises but due to staffing, budget,and structure are frequently not able to easily identify and develop the needed information systems to foster success.  This presentation will describe how the ASEM Information Systems Committee has investigated, selected, and implemented the new society information system (Project Chrysalis).  It will describe application of systems engineering and decision methods to analyze the previous system and select the new platform.  Finally it develops a general model of data integration for professional societies.  The paper discusses the sources and uses of data, information reports, and data base compatibility issues which are often obstacles to systems integration.  The presentation provides an overview of the new ASEM  capabilities and encourages use of and feedback about the improved system capabilities.   ",
32,Exploring the Application of Agile Management Practices to Higher Education Institutions ,,,"Agile management practices are based on an iterative cycle that seeks to ensure design and development projects are delivered according to schedule and budgetary constraints while allowing flexibility to be applied to the project scope.  This approach has been developed in the software industry as an alternative to the traditional waterfall project management methodology and as an approach to accommodate the uncertainty that accompanies software development.  The agile methodology is focused on reducing administration and excessive planning through adopting lean practices and related areas include Scrum, Extreme Programming and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method).  Agile is now being applied to areas beyond the IT sector and the question arises: Can agile management practices be applied to higher education institutions?  Universities are complex organisations undertaking research, education and translation activities supported by a range of administrative areas and professional services.  Universities also face a number of challenges, including financial pressures and funding constraints, increasing levels of competition and the introduction of new technologies.  Therefore, this paper will provide a review of agile management and examine how agile management can be applied to the operations of universities.  This will include exploration of a series of illustrative cases that will identify the pros and cons of applying agile management techniques at universities.  Following conclusions the paper will include a series of recommendations on the potential application of agile management practices to higher education institutions.",
33,Impact of Generation Source on National Residential Energy Cost ,,," As energy generation expands to meet the energy demanded by the public, energy policy makers must understand and anticipate the long term cost of investment in generation infrastructure. Energy sources have associated costs that pass through the generation utility to the consumer. These costs include, but are not limited to fuel, transportation, transmission, and overhead. This research focuses on the most prominent energy sources used in the United States, including coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, renewables, and hydro. The supplementary costs of operation to the utility, and the inherent fixed cost of operation, were isolated for each energy source, as components of an end users unit energy cost. Using data on each states energy generation and demand, a regression analysis was performed to determine the impact of each generation source on the consumer rate, separated by state. The overall results of the regression analysis provide a national index which defines the expected cost of each energy source in a utilitys portfolio. This information can be used to identify value of new energy sources within an existing portfolio, or the decision to increase costs to a consumer to meet expected increase in portfolio costs.   ",
34,Learning by Doing - Energy Systems Management ,,,"Energy underpins all social and economic activities in any nation. Revolution of energy technologies in increasing efficiency and diversity of recourses, as well as climate change concerns has confronted policy makers by unprecedented challenges. Making decision on the right mixture of energy resources and investments on emerging technologies is becoming a more critical issue, which requires a systems thinking approach towards these problems. On the other hand, there is a considerable lack in educational system, offering a comprehensive approach toward current 21st century energy challenges. In order to fulfill those needs, an interdisciplinary graduate certificate course work was designed at Old Dominion University. Considering, the interdisciplinary nature of energy issues, this graduate course work covers from cradle to grave of energy systems, including production options, distribution technologies, and consumption environmental consequences. This course is designed to provide a big picture of energy issues covering from policy level debates, new revolutionary technologies such as smart grids and fracking, as well as decision making tools. By adopting learning by doing concept, we introduce students with two current software for analyzing feasibility of energy projects and due to common hands on approach in our engineering school, we asked students to design and assess energy projects using the tools. Last year, we presented the concept of this course at ASEM conference, this year we are interested to provide the results of our learning by doing approach, discussing on four cases in solar energy, wind energy, hydro power, and geothermal energy.",
35,An Online Scheduling Mechanism for Vehicle-to-Grid Operation ,,,"A major issue associated with large scale adoption of plug-in electric vehicles is the potential impact that charging these vehicles will have on the power grid. If charging of plug-in electric vehicles is not managed, there could be negative impacts on the grid. In a vehicle-to-grid system, charging and discharging of plug-in electric vehicles can be controlled to avoid worsening peak loads and to provide other beneficial services to the grid. It is also important to consider the needs of customers in system because if they are repeatedly unsatisfied with the service provided by the aggregator, they may not participate at all. This paper develops an algorithm to optimally schedule plug-in electric vehicles in a vehicle-to-grid parking lot. Scheduling is carried out over a planning horizon in which plug-in electric vehicle requests arrive dynamically. This study is a step towards developing a mathematical model that schedules the centralized charging and discharging of plug-in electric vehicles while taking into account preferences of customers. Results of this study can be used for management and planning purposes for future vehicle-to-grid systems particularly in applications where fully centralized control is needed for system operation.",
36,A Meta-heuristic Approach to Locate Optimal Switch Locations in Cellular Mobile Networks ,,,"With increasing usage of cellular phones, providing optimum communication service systems becomes a strategic decision to increase subscriber satisfaction. In order to respond to this growing demand it is essential to have a proper design of mobile networks by optimally locating facilities such as Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), switches, etc. In this study, a kind of honeybee-inspired algorithm called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is utilized to solve the problem of assigning cells to switches in the Personal Communication Services (PCS) networks. The model is mathematically developed as a binary non-linear problem with the objective of minimizing cost, which includes handoff and cabling costs. Each switch has a call handling capacity that is equal for other switches. The cells locations are known, and each cell can only be connected to one switch which makes the binary non-linear model of our problem as a single homed model. This problem is categorized as a Capacitated P-Median Problem (CPMP). It has been proven in the literature that these types of problems are Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) which need meta-heuristic algorithms to be solved. At first, various parameters of the ABC algorithm are calibrated by conducting full factorial experimental design. Numerical examples are generated in order to evaluate the performance of the ABC algorithm by comparing it with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in terms of objective function and CPU time. Comparison results show satisfactory performance of ABC algorithm.",
37,An analysis of the potential isomorphic elements between military reconstruction operations and emergency management recovery phase ,,,"With a number of national and international military operations over the last decade, the need for reconstruction in the conflict-affected areas becomes apparent. Reconstruction operations executed by the military involve tasks like trust building with community leaders, construction or reconstruction of critical infrastructure and buildings, and supply of electricity, water, and heat. Food delivery, schools, roads, and healthcare facilities have the highest priority. Once the reconstruction effort is stabilized with high priority needs being addressed, additional community-building is requisite. In humanitarian missions, the local population may need education on trade skills and fundamentals of societal organization. Emergency management, in non-military situations, deals with manmade and natural disasters and tries to avoid, control, manage, and eliminate, as far as possible, the inherent losses that result from major disasters. The four phases of emergency management are mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Within the recovery phase, emergency responders must deal with damage assessment, cleanup operations, and basic reconstruction. The focal points during reconstruction are on critical systems and facilities like healthcare, schools, and roads. Furthermore, the provision for temporary basic needs is crucial. This article explores which elements of the emergency management recovery phase and military reconstruction operations are potentially isomorphic and which elements do not exhibit isomorphic behavior. A conventional product life cycle is transferred to an operation life cycle to divide both operations into segments. This analysis leads to a deeper systemic understanding of the recovery phase in emergency management and assists technical managers tasked with these responsibilities.",
38,Analysis of the Critical Characteristics in Modeling the Economics of Blast Fragment Dispersion of Hazardous Materials ,,,"The significance of a thorough understanding and analysis of hazards and threats in an industrial operation cannot be overstated, but equally important is the development of potential accident scenarios and the calculation of the probable costs of failure of all safety barriers and controls.  Operations having high consequences of failures at any step should be managed as a High Reliability Organization (HRO).  Published characteristics of an HRO state that the organization performing highly hazardous operations must embrace two critical requirements; 1) stochastic analysis of hazards and threats, and 2) accident scenario development with economic consequence calculations.  It is difficult and costly to perform the second requirement in order to accurately forecast cost impacts of a catastrophic accident.  Due to the cost of this requirement, organizations are not always able to commit the resources necessary to do the work.  This paper presents a preliminary analysis under development of the critical characteristics involved in modeling the economics of blast fragmented dispersion of hazardous materials.  A general methodology called HTAC (Hazards-Threats-Accidents-Consequences) Analysis, which utilizes several tools is presented as a model for cost estimation of barriers, controls, accidents and consequences.  The model is able to determine accurately the consequences and associated costs of a catastrophic accident for justifying the costs of barriers and controls.",
39,Cybersociophysical Systems: A New Human Factors Approach ,,,"Even though many innovations related to Cybersociophysical Systems (CSPS) already exist, its significance is only now being recognized. Researchers have not always viewed Cyberphysical Systems (CPS) as having a social component. The socio component has a greater importance and scope than one can imagine. This paper proposes that cyberphysical systems can be improved to be more valid for social dynamics and interactions occurring during design and after release. Humans are at both ends of the system, as both designers and users. The importance of humans in context, the role of humans in all stages of development of a system, and the human factors to be considered before and during the development stages of a system, and these are presented as key to the development of effective CSPS. However, engineering management activities must account for the demands on designers and users when planning the development of such complex systems. To facilitate effective development, an iterative life cycle is discussed, with explanations of ways to proceed with the development and management of a system.",
40,A Proposed Conceptual Model to Analyze Team Congruence at a Large Manufacturing Operation ,,,"Large manufacturers progressively implementing lean across their organization must establish a balanced pull system. Implementing lean across an organization takes time, over which individuals and teams will go through training to understand lean and its application to their work. Looking at an organization as a system it is important to understand the role each team plays in the work of other teams. Lean implementations in one area has the potential to disrupt production in another. Establishing a balanced pull system requires understanding the current state of the organization, the motivation from each team (their weltanschauung), the interconnectedness of individual teams, and what can be done to limit disruption to the final production schedule while progressing with lean implementation. We propose an approach to identifying the current state and motivations that exist in each team of the organization, the first portion of creating a balanced pull system. Step one is a preliminary survey that provides a basic understanding of the current state that exists for each team in the organization, and their basic motivations. Step two involves application of interviews with unique protocols based on their progression through the lean implementation. The interviews provide a more complete understanding of the current state in each teams areas and the weltanschauung of each team as a whole. Engineering managers reading this paper can benefit by realizing the importance of looking at their organization and lean implementation efforts as a system.",
41,Survey of Internet of Things for Quality Assurance of an Engineering Design Firm,,,"This presentation investigates the recent development of Internet of Things (IOT) for tracking the quality after engineering design processes.  The IOT technology could reduce cost of quality in the entire process.  The cost of quality for an engineering design firm has been calculated.  It found 5% for the investment in the prevention phase may reduce the total cost of the quality.  However, if the application of IOT technology and the integration of the information system for the entire process may efficiently approach an even more high quality of the entire system.",
42,Surprises and Cost Overrun: A Lean Risk Management Approach to Reduce Surprises and Address Cost Overruns In Aerospace Product Development Projects ,,,"Cost Overrun continues to burden aerospace product development projects, and its contributing factors need to be better understood.  In line with this effort this paper explores, through multiple case studies within a major aerospace firm, the relationship between the engineering risk management performance and product development projects scope changes driving Cost Overrun, as it evolves over time.  Our research provides fresh and novel empirical evidence about of the ability of an ISO31000 based technical risk management process and organization to uncover uncertainty early in PD projects.  A novel lean risk management performance metric entitled Surprises is developed, together with a systematic method for data mining technical expressions of uncertainty.  We postulate that a reduction of Surprises could help reduce project Cost Overrun.  This lean approach to risk management provides for the early detection of new and emerging risks associated labelled as Surprises, leading to scope changes and Cost Overrun, over the entire product development project lifespan.  Our analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between the extent of the independent Surprise metric and the PD project Cost Overrun response.  This paper explores how the use of a novel lean risk management method supplements conventional ISO31000 based processes, and can be used to improve the value of the risk assessment process through reduced Surprises, effort required and lead time, to ultimately address the major concern about aerospace product development Cost Overrun.",
43,"System Dynamics Model of Project Dynamics in the Electricity industry in Sub Saharan Africa: Model Credibility Testing, Evaluation and Validation ",,,"In Africa, major projects are presently in progress to upgrade the infrastructure in the energy sector, and especially in the electricity energy sub sector. Many such projects have run into delays, quality problems and cost overruns. The hypothesis points to the many risks and uncertainties that exist in projects of this nature in the energy sector in Kenya and the Sub Saharan Africa region. In this paper, we introduce a system dynamics model of the project dynamics in the electricity energy sector in Kenya developed using the system dynamics approach. The paper outlines the tests and results carried out on the basic simulation model to check for right behavior for the right reasons, and behavior pattern tests done by comparing the simulated model behavior to the behavior from previous similar projects in the industry. Finally, sensitivity analysis, the study of model responses to model changes, is done to test the effects of uncertainties in parameter values on the model outcome so as to direct further work on the parameters and structure that signi?cantly affect the behavior, with the aim of generating insights about the structure, behaviors and the real world. The results of the testing are used to improve the initial basic model.",
44,Quality in Project Management: Do we have the right paradigm? ,,,"Quality in Project Management: Do we have the right paradigm? An inspection of the Project Quality Management knowledge area within the Project Management Body of Knowledge suggests significant influence from the foundational thought leaders within quality management.  Strong emphasis is given within this knowledge area to the Seven tools of quality management as pioneered and promoted by figures such as Deming and Kaoru Ishikawa. It is observed however that this important toolset has its origins in high volume manufacturing. Further, the applicability of many of these tools outside of the context of an ongoing operation would appear to be limited in many cases. Given that projects are unique, complex, and defined as temporary endeavors, it raises questions regarding how quality within the context of project management should be managed. As an example, to what degree does statistical process control have a role to play in the development and delivery of complex, one-off systems? This paper systematically compares and contrasts quality management in projects and ongoing operations, and provides recommendations for a new project quality management framework from the literature of project as well as quality management.",
45,Introducing Bio-based Additive Manufacturing to an Engineering Facility ,,,"Innovative product development and manufacturing technologies are vital to a robust economy.  Recent national emphases on STEM disciplines and breakthrough research in these areas underscores the importance of innovation and disruptive technologies to increased economic activity effects.  One of the hot areas of emerging technology applications in industry is that of additive manufacturing (AM). While the AM process may produce parts from both metallic inputs and polymer resins, this effort focuses on the polymer area and specifically bio-based polymers. The research examines process and technology aspects which may impact performance and capabilities.  In order to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating bio-based AM into an engineering setting, the Plastics Laboratory of Northern Illinois University has conducted a study. The required steps were the purchase of a 3D printer, installation and trouble-shooting of the printer, creation of sample parts, generation of test coupons for mechanical testing, and testing per ASTM specifications. This programs effectiveness is judged by the ease at which the AM technology is made operational as well as the properties of resulting parts. Properties include appearance, durability, and strength. The property evaluation is especially important as quality is dependent on how the part is oriented during the build, along with other factors, and strength is lower when compared to parts made by traditional plastics processing methods. For success, the printer must be relatively easy to install and operate, and parts must have a minimum amount of strength.  ",
46,Business Applications of the Integrated Management Model ,,,"The Integrated Management Model (IMM) is shown on page 14 in the third edition of the Guide to the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK).  The first version of the model appeared in the publication Engineering Management International in 1982 (Westbrook).  A more complete version, was published (Westbrook, 2011) and appears as shown in the EMBOK.   The IMM was developed to show the interrelationships between management elements and the organizational internal and external environments.  The primary message of the model is to demonstrate that management should not focus on any one element to manage an organization.  There exists a tendency to look at one element to improve organizational performance; for example  reorganize the structure, adopt the latest management fad or focus on keeping key employees happy.  The model suggests that management must take all three elements, people,  structure and management systems) into account while having a thorough understanding of its internal and external environments.  The IMM proposes to integrate the concepts shown in Domains 2 and 3 of the EMBOK as a way to manage more effectively or implement improvements.  The paper presents an explanation of the elements of the IMM as well as descriptions of the organizational internal and external environments.  Applications of the model are shown in two different types of organizations.  One organization is an engineering organization that supports a military research and development mission.  The other organization is a small carbon fiber research organization.  The applications of the model are quite different and are intended to",
47,When a Business Gets Itself into a Pickle: Sources of Value from Cucumber Process Co-Products,,,"The food processing industry, like other production-oriented segments, is becoming more focused on good stewardship of the resources used in and around its production processes.  Some of this is encouraged through federal and state policies; additionally, many operations are held accountable on these metrics by measures derived at a local or organizational level.  Some corporations have begun to incentivize regional business units and production facilities to do a better job of creating value from resources and inputs.  One way of measuring this is to decrease the amount of products leaving a facility not in a value-added state.  This research looks at one such opportunity, namely the processing co-product from a pickle production facility.  The research follows a process in order to identify and examine a range of new use options for building economic value through the conversion of such production scrap into a higher value product.",
48,Productivity Improvement of Production Floor Line Balancing: A Case Study at a Manufacturing Company ,,,"The manufacturing of medical devices involves a complex network of interactions and material flows. These complex interactions are very likely to lead to wastes and overlaps in the processes, thereby adding cost and inefficiency in the overall manufacturing process. This paper presents a case study of a biomedical manufacturing focusing on productivity improvement. The Six-Sigma DMAIC approach is used to identify wastes and improve the processes. Initially, several time studies are conducted to measure the work content of the selected assembly line by including any personal allowances and unavoidable delays. The productivity analysis is then performed by preparing the balance sheets that visually map work content in order to create continuous flow, meet customer demands and identify improvement opportunities. Furthermore, our findings suggest that sustaining a culture of Lean or continuous improvement can be difficult after the enthusiasm of the transformation fades. Therefore, in order to sustain the real productivity gains the process improvement, an organization has to ensure come that it becomes everybody's job to find opportunities for improvement rather than the domain of a specialized few.",
49,An analysis of the potential of companys inter-cooperation on shop-floor level through the utilization of cyber physical production systems ,,,"In recent years, the advances in automation of production has increased significantly. The expansion of intelligent objects (defined as: technical systems with substantial software components) is predicted to continue over the coming years. One possible outcome with regards to this development is the interconnection between embedded systems and cyber physical production systems (CPPS). In this scenario there is recognition of an even higher degree of complex automation and peripheral distributed controlling intelligence. As such, great potential exists for the enhancement of the present efficiency of production systems. One outcome for the previously described development is an improvement in cooperation along the value-adding network - commonly referred to as supply network.  The use of cyber physical production systems is a solutions-based approach to stimulate the cooperation of various enterprises on the shop-floor level. This article seeks to investigate and analyze this possible development. First, the traditional cooperation between enterprises regarding their supply network management is described. Afterwards, a possible practical application of the CPPS approach on the shop-floor level for a company is illustrated. To conclude, the differences between the traditional and the CPPS approaches are explained. Key points within this article are intelligent machines, intelligent products, and their connection to one other across a companys previous boundaries - enabled by the shop floors integration in the internet of things.",
50,A Life Cycle Analysis Approach for Making Sustainable Fiber Optic Purchasing Decisions in the Telecommunication Industry ,,,"In recent decades, substantial research has surfaced that links global climate change with the human element. As the human species has evolved, the industrialization of prosperous nations has produced extreme consequences on our environment. Continual degradation of our surroundings has proven detrimental to our future. With this in mind, many companies are making progressive steps to become environmentally friendly; even telecom providers are researching ways that they might optimize their network grids in order to achieve greater efficiencies and reduce waste. Although this emergence of green thinking is beneficial to our environment, many of these thoughts are coming after potentially dangerous products have already been placed on the open market. Recently, a form of analysis has been developed that details the exact environmental footprint of any process, product or material. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is globally recognized as the leading technique to evaluate the sustainability of a product or service. This cradle-to-grave software evaluates the impacts of products or materials from the extraction of their raw materials to their eventual disposal. With this information in hand, companies can begin making sound decisions toward the development and production of an eco-friendly product, all while realizing potential cost-cutting opportunities through the use of alternative materials.  This paper aims to revise and redirect the current purchasing habits of a major telecom provider by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in conjunction with LCA of the synthetic material used in the exterior jacketing of fiber optic cables, thus creating a much more sustainable decision process.",
51,System Dynamics Analysis of Factors Impacting on Command and Control Technology Acceptance for Anti-Poaching Operations ,,,"Introducing a new technology into a complex sociotechnical system will have planned as well as unplanned impact. Often people in the system employ the technology differently than intended. Dynamic interaction between the technology, people and environment may also result in counter intuitive systemic effects. Modelling of the system and the new technology can help to understand the requirements for successful implementation of the technology. This paper demonstrates a modelling methodology that combines two modelling frameworks, Cognitive Work Analysis and System Dynamics, to model the effect of a new technology on complex sociotechnical system. Cognitive Work Analysis helps to convert available information on the system and the application of technology into constructs. The System Dynamics method analyses the causal relationships between the variables in the system. The aim of the modelling framework is to address the complex sociotechnical and dynamic effects between a new technology, people in the system and operational environment. The modelling methodology is demonstrated through modelling and simulation of the effect of web based and smartphone technology on an anti-poaching Command and Control system. Systems Dynamics simulations are used to assess the impact of different factors on system effectiveness. The constructs, model artefacts and simulation results of the methodology provided insight into the impact of the new technology to derive system requirements. This will assist in planning change management for its successful implementation.",
52,"Application of Systems Models in Strategic, and Risk Management Contexts",,,"This paper proposes a system models in context such as enterprise and strategic risk management and marketing. Engineering managers often feel confined to technical areas of management, unable to exert influence in the general management. At the same time, management itself has been a nebulous profession with significant hand waving. By judiciously employing system models, both at conceptual and detailed levels, this paper proposes a solution to both understanding the organizational, contextual and human behavioural factors in a transparent manner. The application of systems dynamic and agent based models in strategic planning and strategic risk and marketing are discussed. The systems models can be used as an organizing principle, framework and simulation test bed. Such model building is both transdisciplinary and integrative, and uses a variety of concepts, such as flows, stocks, influencing factors, feedback loops, delays and agents, which are well-suited for increasingly complex risk environments. Systems models allow the integration of elements across multiple dimensions, namely (a) spatial: connecting entities in space (e.g. flows), (b) domain concepts: based on the domain relationships, (c) temporal: when the models are developed into simulation models, they allow for one to step through time, and (d) social: bringing different perspectives together.",
53,A Dynamic Model of Job Satisfaction and Turnover: Framework for Model Development and Simulation ,,,"Employee retention has become an increasing focus in engineering management, as corporations have begun to recognize the value of people as individuals, as well as the value of their cumulative knowledge and skills. Although a substantial amount of study and investment has been done in order to measure and predict the causes of voluntary employee turnover, there still remains a high variability in predicting patterns of workforce behavior across various industries. For example, some companies have found the existence of amenities such as gyms or internet cafes tend to increase job satisfaction; however, the effects can be short term and the next hired generation might not find the amenities provided as attractive. Hence, the ability to maintain and encourage employee loyalty is rooted in the understanding of the complex system of factors that affect their decisions. The ability to capture these factors and their behaviors will be critical to future development of engineering management approaches in support of employee retention. Visual representations of changes over time can be especially valuable to decision makers. The objective of this study is to develop a robust dynamic model that can represent and anticipate changes in employee job satisfaction through the use of system dynamics methods. With the use of statistical analysis and system dynamics, statistically significant parameters can be selected and then varied to observe their effects on the behaviors of the main variables. Conclusions are drawn to provide decision support to management toward the goal of employee retention.",
54,Determinants of Collaborative Relationship and Its Impact on Collaboration Value Creation in the Integrated Project Team ,,,"In the integrated project team, collaborative relationship is not without risk, though it is in an increasing need to be regarded as a productive resource for value creation. This study investigates two main issues: firstly, what are the main determinants of the collaborative relationship among the integrated project team members and, secondly, how it affects collaboration value creation. We propose hypotheses of the study based on extensive literature review. With data collected from a structured online questionnaire that was sent to members of integrated project teams, these hypotheses are then tested by structural equation modeling. The results indicate that trust and organization control are the main determinants of collaborative relationship. Furthermore, the more tense the collaborative relationship is, the more obstacles collaboration value creation encounters in the integrated project team. The findings of this study can significantly help collaborative relationship management and enhance collaboration value creation in the integrated project team.",
55,Overcoming the Innovation Execution Gap: A Process for Enhancing the Success of Company Innovation Initiatives ,,,"For most companies successful innovation is an execution problem, not an ideation problem. Through existing tools and processes companies are increasingly trying to answer externally-focused innovation questions such as, Why do customers engage with our company? and How can we provide additional value to current and potential customers? Equally important, but seldom the focus of project leaders, are internal questions such as, Why is our company pursuing an innovation initiative? Furthermore, when companies identify and actively pursue an innovation project, they often fail to fully assess and evaluate both the needs of the innovation project and the current capabilities of their organization. This failure to adequately assess and evaluate often results in unanticipated execution challenges for engineering managers. Example challenges include determining ways to implement the innovation project within the context of the existing performance engine, hiring or developing specialized expertise, and leading multifunctional teams having different goals and structures. Combining both theoretical and practical engineering management knowledge, this paper describes a process that supports project leaders as they determine which innovation projects are worth pursuing and an implementation methodology that promotes the discovery of knowable obstacles to success inherent within the organization. Our process integrates design, systems, and business thinking and uses the canvas methodology, a proven facilitation, collaboration, and teamwork approach, to help leaders discover, clarify and understand their innovation project in the context of their existing organization. Importantly, our work supports current and future engineering managers as they design, contribute to and lead innovation efforts within their organization.",
56,Service-Learning: An Opportunity for Experiential Learning in Project Management ,,,"Throughout an undergraduate program in engineering, there are multiple opportunities for hands on laboratory experiences that are related to course content.  However, a similar immersive experience for engineering management graduate students is harder to incorporate for all students in a course at once.  For example, team projects can be used, but only one student can be the leader at a time. A computer simulation can enable all students to be leaders of simulated teams, but the simulated experience may lack realism or completeness.  This paper explores an experiential learning opportunity for graduate students in engineering management or project management programs: leading a team of undergraduates through a project in a service-learning course.",
57,The Requirements for Engineering Management Education in the Turkish Environment ,,,"A central issue of engineering education is how to equip the young engineers for making rational commercial, social, and environmental judgments. The engineering professionals are expected to take on management responsibilities during their careers. The analytical abilities of engineers may be utilised to improve the quality of their judgements in non-technical matters. Engineering Management plays a significant role with management functions arrayed along a cognitive continuum between analysis and intuition. This requirement introduces a critical agenda for research and teaching in Engineering Management for improving the quality of management judgements at the intuitive end of the continuum. The growth of Engineering Management Programs attracts attention and interest to education and research directions in this field.             The purpose of this research is to study the requirements of Engineering Management Education. A survey is conducted to achieve the aims of the research. The findings of the study focus on the following issues:",
58,Application of Resilient Systems Thinking to Sustain a Lean Organizational Culture ,,,"Lean manufacturing systems have afforded organizations sizable gains in productivity, profitability, and overall performance. However, the resulting inter-industry diffusion of Lean has revealed obstacles to effective lean implementation.  The literature documents the unsatisfactory results of unsuccessful implementation attempts. The literature also links these unsatisfactory implementation results to suboptimal lean behaviors, poor lean leadership and culture, and to the nature and quality of continuous improvement training. In light of these challenges, this paper suggests a framework that promotes the development of a resilient continuous improvement culture by applying single to double-loop learning and the theory of conceptual change. This research identifies approaches for engineering managers to avoid lean culture problems by developing techniques to change the mentality of employees and, in turn, facilitate lean manufacturing success.",
59,Operational Adaptability: Conceptualization and Measures of the Construct ,,,"This investigation contributes a concept of operational adaptability and empirically tests a set of proposed measures of the construct. In general terms, operational adaptability is the ability to successfully respond to unforeseen changing situations during the operation of work units. The concept of operational adaptability was developed by using current literature and our experience as applied researchers. Seventy members of the military answered a survey of 10 questions that intent to measure the construct of operational adaptability. Principal component factor analysis and reliability analysis were conducted during a statistical construct validation process. The results confirm that the measures developed in the investigation are reliable and possess construct validity. The results of this investigation can be used as foundation for further research and development in the area of operational adaptability and operational uncertainty.",
60,Multinational Business Optimisation: A Systems Approach ,,,"Current developments in technology together with the global village concept have contributed to large international corporates becoming a reality. Total business optimisation requires the enablement of all business process. On a global optimisation view the two dimensions of delivery include shop floor to top floor and global, end to end perspectives.                 The current operations of individual production units, independent of global subsidiaries are a distinct challenge as independent operations divert the potential of global assets/ supply optimisation. Crucially is the fact that research, technology development, asset optimisations, planning, corporate (strategy, investment planning, and finance), supply chain and other function of large multinationals are usually centralised. These central functions operate independently with crucial dependencies on operational, site to global, information. The current practice of manual/paper base information is limited specifically to human dependencies such as, obtainability, accuracy, time, and interpretation. These key issues result in a multidimensional and multilayer challenge of total business optimization. Total business optimization must include, but not be limited to, production, supply chain, human resources, finance, Information management, plant control, research, technology development, together with sales and distribution. The additional complexity of multisite operations must also be included in order to achieve true global, end to end, optimization. There has been development in deployment of limited solutions but replication and accelerated delivery can only be addressed via a standardized approach. This research proposes a standardization, global system approach to this challenge from Enterprise Resource Planning through manufacturing systems down to instrumentation.",
61,Safety: Let's Start at the Beginning ,,,"When examining the life cycle of any given product, the consideration of workplace safety usually does not come into the picture until the production process. At this point in the products life cycle, workplace safety is managed as a compliance activity, and any accident that occurs will be managed with the goal of preservation and cost minimization.  This passive and reactionary approach to safety creates an oppositional relationship between the safety experts, production managers, and design and process engineers, where each have different, often incongruous goals and performance measures while dealing with the same processes. Safety, production, and engineering research exist in the same space, involve the same workers and production system. Engineers design and maintain products and processes and ties its outcomes to effective, efficient and safe production systems. Operations management improves workplace practices and ties its outcomes to cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility, but generally does not explicitly consider safety as an operating priority.  Safety research focus on improving workplace safety practices and ties its outcomes to preventing injury and illness, and minimizing their associated costs, but does not often make explicit linkages to operating and engineering priorities. Addressing the oppositional relationship between safety, engineers and production managers is crucial to successful workplace safety. One method to accomplish this is to ensure that safety, engineers and production managers have the same goals and performance measures. This paper presents a conceptual model to create common goals and performance measures by incorporating workplace safety into the entire product life cycle.",
62,Systemic Intervention for Complex System Governance,,,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the issues related to intervention in Complex System Governance (CSG).  Systems intervention seeks to intentionally engage a situation to influence trajectory or outcomes.  Complex System Governance is an emerging field focused on the design, execution, and evolution of the functions necessary to provide continued system performance (stability) in the midst of incessant turbulence and increasing complexity.   Integral to this field is the necessity to intervene in a complex system to address behavior or performance that is inconsistent with that which is desired.  Intervention is undertaken by internal as well as external agents as a key to modify complex systems.  Arguably, these interventions have an unremarkable record of success, ranging from touted success in improving a situation (system) to abysmal failure (doing more harm than good).  However, little emphasis has been placed on a more rigorous exploration of the nature of intervention as it influences our ability to more effectively enact change in complex systems.  To address this sparse accounting in the literature, following a brief introduction, this paper pursues three primary objectives.  First the nature of systemic intervention is examined.  Second, the different roles in systemic intervention for complex systems are explored.  Third, critical issues and considerations for more effective systemic intervention are suggested.  The paper concludes with directions for future development of systemic intervention for CSG as a critical competence for practitioners and an important capability for enterprises of the future.",
63,Character Development Strategy in the Department of Systems Engineering at the United States Military Academy ,,,"Included in the mission statement at the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point is the requirement to produce individuals who are certified in character (honor). Each department at USMA has an overarching responsibility to build character or facilitate character development. At USMA, we want each graduates character to be marked with the values of West Point and the Army ethic. Thus, each department must establish a thoughtful character development model that describes what actions are necessary and periodically assess the strategys effectiveness. Included in this model will be five character development activities that utilize the guidelines and character development model to integrate character development into existing activities. The purpose of this research is to develop and articulate the strategy and activities for the Department of Systems Engineering (DSE). Using the Stanford d School Design Thinking Methodology we define the problem using empathy, develop an unexpected range of possible solutions, and create rough prototypes that will be implemented with the DSE. With this methodology we move toward action, reflect on the process and run through the cycles bringing stronger insights and more unexpected solutions.",
64,University Technology Transfer Information Processing from the Attention Based View ,,,"Between 2005 and 2011, there was no substantial growth in licenses executed by university technology transfer offices.  Since the passage of the Bayh Dole Act of 1980, universities have owned technological inventions afforded by federal research funding.  There are still university technology transfer offices that struggle with increasing their licensing revenues.  There is a persistent underperformance by university technology transfer offices.  This paper makes the contribution of advocating the novel use of cognitive thinkings attention based view to university technology transfer in order to resolve this problem.   The attention based view teaches that human attention is limited and organizations are limited in what they pay attention to (Cyert, 1963; Ocasio, 1997).  It is argued herein that universities may struggle with increasing their licensing revenues because they are not paying sufficient attention to licensing.   Awareness of the problem is the first step in resolving it.  It is propositioned that university technology transfer office staff pay more attention to intellectual property protection than patent marketing or licensing and this result in lower licensing revenues and lower overall performance.  It is also propositioned that technology transfer offices with less experienced staff pay more attention to intellectual property protection than patent marketing and licensing.",
65,Virtue in the Engineering Profession  A paradigm shift in how we teach engineering ethics. ,,,"In engineering programs throughout the US, engineering ethics is taught in a variety of ways and methods.  One of the more robust methods to address engineering ethics is the classical case study approach.  Additionally, engineering ethics seems to focus less on actually internalizing ethical characteristics and more on what should the person have done versus what the person should be.  An engineer relying strictly on a set of codes and rules is not a good paradigm for creating ethical engineers.  A new approach to engineering ethics is proposed and opens the aperture on the current pedagogy and lays out a methodology radically different but more effective.  The concept of virtue is introduced early in the engineering students education.  Without a clear understanding of how one becomes virtuous, the ability for an engineer student to internalize ethical behavior is a frustrating and unrealistic endeavor.  The program is three fold.  The first phase is an introductory class developed specifically for engineering students which takes the student through understanding of virtue and ethics.  The mentor program lasts for several semesters and requires reflective sessions of certain concepts.  The desired goal is for the student to understand and embrace a virtue.  Without this internal desire the program for the student is not effective.  As the student progresses, the program of ethical case studies is introduced as a senior level course or seminar.  At this point student has greater understanding of the impact of ethical behavior in the engineering profession.  It has the added benefit",
66,A structured Review of Lean Supply Chain Management in Health Care ,,,"Lean supply chain management illustrates a new approach to supplier networks. Lean principles require long-term supplier relationships and a higher integrated supply chain management system. Improvement of supplier partnerships and long-term strategic alliances are two main success factors of a lean system. The healthcare industry is one of the most important service sectors; nevertheless, just a few studies have been conducted on lean supply chain in this industry. Improving the supply chain system by using lean principles causes higher quality in health care companies.   Lean consists of principles that drive health care companies to continually add value for the organization by improving processes. Although Lean has been applied in manufacturing more than 40 years, its principles are suited to help health care companies to improve systems by systematically addressing the quality, cost and safety. To become a lean health care organization, a company should plan to achieve long-term relationships with their suppliers. Supplier selection criteria will have a significant effect on increasing added value for lean systems. In this paper, by reviewing relevant literature, we compile a set of criteria which should be considered in lean supply chain network design in the health care industry. The results of this study will be beneficial for health care organizations to improve their supply chain management system.",
67,Integrating FAHP with COPRAS-G Method for Supplier Selection (Case Study: an Iranian Manufacturing Company) ,,,"Supplier selection has become a core competency for many companies, however, the nature of these decisions can be complex and unstructured. This paper presents a fuzzy-Grey decision-making approach designed for supplier selection which is generally considered a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. As is the nature of real world MCDM application, both quantitative and qualitative factors must be considered along with the feedback of decision makers. The introduction of expert opinion requires a robust methodology since their judgments and preferences are often vague and cannot be easily estimated with a numerical value. In this paper, an integration of a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the Complex Proportional Assessment of alternatives to Grey relations (CORPAS-G) is proposed to prioritize suppliers in an Iranian manufacturing industry. Commonly cited criteria for supplier selection are identified via literature review and selected by experts. Linguistic values which are expressed in triangular fuzzy numbers are then used to assess the ratings for criteria which are weighted based on the applied AHP model and fuzzy logic. After obtaining each criterions weight, suppliers are ranked based on the COPRAS-G method. Lastly, advantages of using fuzzy and grey values to tackle uncertainty in decision makers judgments are discussed.",
68,Use of Traffic Simulators to Determine Driver Response to Work Zone Configurations ,,,"Improving work zone road safety is an issue of great interest due to the high number of crashes observed in work zones. Departments of Transportation (DOTs) use a variety of methods to inform drivers of upcoming work zones. One method used by DOTs is work zone signage configuration. It is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of different configurations, by law, before implementation of new signage designs that deviate from national standards. This research presents a driving simulator based study, funded by the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) that evaluates a drivers response to work zone sign configurations. This study has compared the Conventional Lane Merge (CLM) configurations against MoDOT's alternate configurations. Study participants within target populations, chosen to represent a range of Missouri drivers, have attempted four work zone configurations, as part of a driving simulator experience. The test scenarios simulated both right and left work zone lane closures for both the CLM and MoDOT alternatives. Travel time was measured against demographic characteristics of test driver populations. Statistical data analysis was used to investigate the efficiency of different configurations employed in the study. The results of this study were compared to results from a previous MoDOT study.",
69,"Enhancing PLM Using Re-usable, Configurable, MBSE-Based System Patterns to Represent Platforms",,,"Model-based descriptions of systems (product systems, manufacturing systems, and other systems) are emerging from Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). These system models describe the design, requirements, and other life cycle aspects of complex systems. Of particular interest are platform systemsfamilies of configurable systems based on a common structure and configured in different variations optimized for different applications, market segments, or customer instances. This presentation illustrates the use of Pattern-Based Systems Engineering (PBSE), an extension of MBSE, to represent a family of manufacturing systems, including its use in different life cycle processes of ISO 15288. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) methods and systems play critical, high-value roles in this emerging integrated framework, which is itself a system, with its own life cycle. The same underlying methods that improve management of products and services can be used to organize the framework of in which PLM systems are implemented, integrated, and evolved. This project is a collaboration project between university (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis) and industry (ICTT System Sciences). The goal for this project is to implement generic pattern based systems engineering model into PLM software Siemens Teamcenter. Teamcenter is a comprehensive and integrated collection of applications that manage the wide range of information and work processes of products and their supporting systems throughout the products lifecycles. The application most relevant to the Systematica methodology, models, and patterns is Teamcenter Systems engineering. This application includes views with special functionalities to manage physical, logical, functional, and requirement statement hierarchies and the trace relationship between them from a",
70,Social Media for Sustaining Product Innovation: A Design Framework for Capturing Business Insights from User-Generated Content ,,,"The fast paced business environment is increasingly requiring companies to explore the use of external sources of ideas and information to accelerate innovation. Social media, full of users opinions and comments, has been considered as a gold mine for exploring new and useful ideas so as to augment companies competence in innovation. Despite the increasing importance of social media having led more and more firms to engage with it, capturing insightful information and knowledge from the vast amount of online content can be very challenging. Thus far, there is a lack of useful methods that serve to collect and analyze the substantial data effectively. In this study, it is argue that companies need to work systematically to analyze and interpret the online commentaries of social media, for this can enhance in-house research and design activities. In this research, the intention is to find ways of tackling the challenges faced by companies in trying to deal with big data, with the focus on the context of social media. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework, from the design science approach, for automatically gathering and analyzing online commentaries in connection to product innovation, with an establishing web corpus derived from this study. To date, content analysis based on qualitative data collected from the most popular online car discussion forum in Taiwan, namely Mobile01 (www.mobile01.com), has been undertaken. Preliminary research results will be given in this report.",
71,Case Study Research of User Design Methods ,,,"System users have been a demonstrated source of innovations and breakthrough ideas.  While there is a wealth of literature dedicated to understanding this source of innovation for its ability to generate new markets; understanding how users design and change systems remains understudied.  As an initial step, this research seeks to understand problem solving mechanisms employed by users.  To observe this phenomenon, this initial research considers an extreme case of user design, the development of a complex system.  Three categories of change mechanisms were employed by users: user, method and material.  As a departure from traditional design methods it was found that users view themselves as a dynamic component of the system and change themselves or their behaviors to enable system capabilities.  In the case considered, users were able to rapidly develop a complex system to meet new requirements; interestingly this was accomplished with either modular or minimally invasive equipment changes.  While traditional flexible design tenets were present in the materiel components of the system (e.g. robustness and modularity), the skill and capacity of the system users provided a separate source of system flexibility.",
72,Mitigating Turnover of Software Engineers in Department of Defense Contractor Organizations,,,"The replacement of employees due to turnovers has a significant impact on an organizations performance, expenses, and productivity. Previous studies have concluded that motivation and job satisfaction are correlated with an employee's turnover intentions. This study will analyze the relationships between software engineers' personality traits and demographical factors on their job satisfaction and motivation to aid managers in developing more effective solutions for increasing the job satisfaction and motivation of software engineers resulting in a reduction in turnover. Models for mapping software engineers' personality traits, demographical factors, job satisfaction, motivation, and turnover intentions will also be developed. A survey that will collect information on demographics, personality traits, job satisfaction, motivation, and turnover intentions will be sent out to software engineering employees of department of defense contractor organizations for the purposes of this study.",
73,Financial and Groundwater Credit in Contractionary Environments: Implications for Sustainable Groundwater Management and the Groundwater Credit Crunch ,,,"Unsustainable groundwater consumption represents a reliance on environmental credit.  A reduction in groundwater credit availability, by policy or physical constraint, can create an environmental credit crunch homologous to a financial credit crunch.  This paper presents a logical argument for a systemic, structural isomorphology between groundwater credit and financial credit in a contractionary environment.  Monetary policy can be used to contract credit and control the aggregate demand of an economy.  As society transitions to sustainable groundwater management, similar policies may be required to facilitate a contraction of groundwater credit.  The analysis presented may justify the application of knowledge about monetary policy to groundwater management policy.  A comparison of the structural components of each system is presented along with a description of the causal loops of the systems.  The assertion of isomorphic structures is further supported by a logical explanation of the mechanisms of systemic interaction between components of each system.  This analysis can assist technical managers tasked with groundwater management to better understand this complex technical system.     ",
74,Charging Change,,,"The brutal fact that about 70% of change initiatives fail, clearly demonstrates that additional knowledge and guidelines to support organization development and change are needed. For this purpose, this work presents a framework of six batteries of change that seem essential to charge an organizations capacities for change. The framework brings together the expertise of four specialists that all have developed their insights over many years of study and practice, taking a different angle on how to approach change in various types of organizations. The model has been validated through an extensive review of the management literature on organization development and change. The face validity of the framework has been confirmed by several change agents and CEOs of organizations in Belgium. Besides providing a description of the main characteristics of the six batteries, the framework illustrates how sustainable change requires a balance between two dimensions. On one side it is critical to combine a formal, analytical approach with informal, emotional change levers. On the other side, it is essential to assure integration and alignment between the strategic, tactical and operational activities of the organization in order to seek balance between an internal short term perspective, and a long term external perspective, that in many organizations is responsible for tensions between the corporate (global) level and local departments or business units. As such, the framework allows both detecting potential pitfalls and obstacles for change within a specific context and illuminating typical pains of change patterns that can be identified across organizations.",
75,Japanese video game platforms and cellphones: Why did one product category succeed and not the other? ,,,"The year 2015 finds Japanese cellphone manufacturers with less than 2% of the global market. Many factors have been put forward in explanation for the failure of Japanese companies to enjoy sustained success in this market and translate Japanese local innovation to the global arena. Such factors often cited include the isolation and uniqueness of the Japanese market, fragmented cellphone standards, and the difficulty of Japanese companies in collaborating with Western companies in R&D and software development. In contrast, the global videogame platform market is dominated by Japanese manufacturers in spite of facing a growing demand for ever more complex game software and supporting software. The contrast between these two apparently similar product categories raises the question regarding the factors that led to the success of one and the failure of the other. This study examines the literature associated with both fields and develops an explanatory conceptual framework.",
76,Understanding and identifying effective technical problem solving strategies ,,,Problem-solving strategies are critical to effective problem solving yet few individuals and teams understand how these strategies affect their work. A lack of understanding can result in the inability to solve complex problems that in turn raises the costs of solving these problems. This paper will discuss technical problem solving strategies starting with a basic overview of problem solving theory followed by a description of several types of problem solving strategies. The paper will conclude with an explanation of factors to be considered when developing an overall technical problem solving strategy. The intended audience for this paper is managers of teams performing frequent problem solving. Other technical roles such as engineers can apply the ideas in this paper to address technical problems they may face. Individuals can also find value in the recommendations to improve their own technical problem solving strategies as well.,
77,What if the Gurus were Right - Part III ,,,"~~This installment moves away from examining examples of and the reasons for the gap between academic research and the needs of the practitioner.  Here we think about what the gurus have been saying and what potential improvements could be achieved if their ideas were implemented and proved to be correct.  Looking at some past conference papers, we find some ideas that provide different directions that future research could follow and speculate on what benefits could spin out of it.  People such as Frederick Herzberg, Tom Peters, and Henry Mintzberg all reflected at some point in their career on how the implementation of their message and the resulting research did not take the paths they had hoped they had started.  We have all experienced difficulty in getting processes to work consistently and outcomes are often very different than anyone predicted.  Is it possible that focusing on the large scale of organizations and the large samples required to reach statistical significance that we fail to recognize the impact of single individuals?  How much of what we do today has been influenced by the original findings of Frederick Taylor and his one best way to lessen the variability in the skill levels of the workers?  How much have we molded our research to make it fit into a computer analysis and stripped out the factors that do not easily fit into a measureable variable?  What if the gurus have been right all along?",
78,Effective leadership of contingent engineering workers ,,,"Approximately 40% of workers in the USA are employed on a contingent basis (i.e. independent contractors, temporary employees, freelancers), including substantial numbers of engineering professionals.  Engineering managers who utilize contingent engineering workers do not have any formal, legal supervisor-employee hierarchical relationship with them.  However, engineering managers often assume a leadership role in making work assignments, directing activities, evaluating work product and obtaining the best performance from the contingent workers.  How can engineering managers best provide effective leadership to contingent engineering workers without incurring undesirable risk?  What should engineering managers consider in selecting optimal leadership approaches and tactics for the contingent engineering workforce?  The author discusses an extensive body of existing research in presentation of the literature review and new, primary research drawn from surveys of over 4,900 North American engineering professionals is introduced.  Distinctions are drawn between effective leadership practices for regular employees and contingent workers.",
79,Understanding Leadership Development with the Lifetime Leadership Inventory ,,,"As evident by the volume of publications and research studies, leadership is a topic of keen interest to both the general public and researchers.  Since leadership has an impact on all areas of society, this interest is not unexpected.  What is unexpected is that despite all of the attention it garners, leadership remains a poorly understood topic, with scholars unable to even reach consensus on a single definition. Given this state, it is perhaps not surprising that efforts to understand how leaders develop are common in the leadership literature, but offer few clear-cut solutions for how best to grow future leaders.  One reason for this lack of a clear leadership development path is that research into leadership development tends to focus on the characteristics of the leaders being studied, and investigates the experiences that lead to the development of the leader far less often. Studies that do investigate the impact of experiences tend to utilize structured interview techniques, resulting in limited breadth and small sample sizes.  This study sought to provide a means to address this limitation through development of a new instrument, the Lifetime Leadership Inventory (LLI) that investigate a breadth of experiences theorized in the literature to impact leader development.  The LLI enables researchers to understand a breadth of development experiences undertaken by respondents and gather that information from a considerably larger sample than interview based studies enable.  This paper discusses the need for the LLI, its theoretical foundation, and the process undertaken to develop and validate the instrument.",
80,"Lead the Vision, Follow the Path ",,,"This paper discusses the role of followership in the context of visionary leadership. The concept of visionary leadership uses an individuals personal capabilities, behavior, and the effect of organization to determine an individuals approach to leadership. A large part of being able to lead is being able to follow. Many people may believe that a follower simply follows the directives  set in place by a member in a higher hierarchical position and that a leaders sole purpose is to give directions to his/ her subordinates. This ideology holds some merit, however that is not the a complete presentation of the follower-leader dyad. Research has shown that the higher a leader is in the hierarchy, the greater the follower that leader becomes.",
81,What users want from ASEM? An Analysis of ASEM Web Traffic and Social Media Data ,,,"American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) has a very loyal membership base. However, there is a potential national and international membership pool that is untapped. How can we cater to this potential pool of members that can enhance ASEMs global presence? The answer may be in ASEMs website and social media profiles, specifically Facebook and LinkedIn. By analyzing the trends in the website and social media traffic we can better understand our potential membership base and the digital channels through best to reach them. This paper is an attempt at looking at the trends in website data  search terms used to find the website, length of stay on the website, most visited links, and country of origin. A similar analysis will be performed on LinkedIn data  geographical location, career level, career field, and so on. Likewise, Facebook data will also be analyzed due to the fact that it provides a different user base than those who may visit the website or the LinkedIn page, particularly in terms of potential student members. The aim of the paper is to establish a value proposition that may attract future members and retain current members.",
82,The effects of implementation of Service Learning into Engineering Management & Construction Management Courses ,,,"Service learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. Considering the practicality of the engineering profession, the administration and faculty at XYZ University thought it would be beneficial to incorporate service learning into various engineering courses, including Engineering Management (EM) as well as Civil Engineering and Construction Management (CECM) courses, starting in Fall 2014. Faculty members in EM as well as CECM, had contacts in local non-profit organizations and expressed interest to further strengthen their existing relationships with them. This was done by getting real projects that the students would work on, as assignments in their respective classes. Both organizations responded favorably. At the end of the Fall 2014 semester, both faculty members evaluated the effects of the service learning aspect on the student learning outcomes. There will also be a comparative study done between the effects on the undergraduate students as well as the graduate students who participated in this program. The expected findings of this study will help the authors in drawing preliminary conclusions with respect to the implementation of service learning into engineering management, civil engineering and construction management courses. Based on the findings, the authors will decide whether to continue the service learning aspect over a period of 4-6 semesters and make the findings a part of a longitudinal study.",
83,Development of an Integrated Model for New ASEM Products and Services ,,,"Many technical professional societies have technical divisions to which its members can belong.  The American Society for Engineering Management has had no divisional structure since its inception.  Within the last decade, ASEM has developed the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK), which is comprised of eleven domains of knowledge.   The various product and service offerings of ASEM are moving into line with the EMBOK domains as part of the societys strategic plan and vision.  The Society is now considering how to effectively introduce Domain Interest Groups, or DIGs, to better serve its members and the profession worldwide. This paper will present the results of a survey of persons interested in engineering management across the world.  This survey was presented to the ASEM membership, ASEM LinkedIn group, the ASEM Facebook group, the ASEM Twitter group, and others.  Executives, managers, engineers, and students provided feedback relative to their career needs, knowledge domains, professional development, professional certification and licensure, participation in professional societies, and future ASEM conferences.   This information will be used to help identify how interest groups and customer needs can be introduced in order to meet the needs of engineering managers, as well as further the discussion on marketing and developing new products and services by ASEM.",
84,Creating a transactive memory map to improve team knowledge sharing,,,Transactive memory is important to team learning as it defines not only who has information key for completing tasks but also metaknowledge which communicates which team members have what information. An effective transactive memory map aids in understanding how team members locate and share team knowledge so that any opportunities for improving team knowledge sharing can be identified and in identifying transactive memory deficiencies allowing them to address them before team knowledge sharing breaks down. This presentation will discuss how to use cognitive work analysis and network analysis tools to develop a transactive memory map. A brief definition of transactive memory and how it applies to team learning will be provided followed by detailed instructions on how to develop a transactive memory map. Recommendations on how to use the transactive memory map combined with advantages and disadvantages of various transactive memory configurations will conclude the paper. The intended audience for this paper is engineering managers or team leaders although any individual requiring assistance in understanding complex team learning factors would also find the tools and recommendations in this paper useful.,
85,Workplace Competencies: What's Needed,,,"One of the primary strategic requirements in today's competitive environment is that of a competent workforce.  During the last several years, much has been said about a decline in overall competitiveness among U.S. companies.  To some degree, such a decline is said to be traceable to the competency level of U.S. workers. This paper explores the issue of employee (worker) competence levels in the U.S.  Attempts are made to assess the following basic questions:  What competencies are needed in U.S. companies today?  What competencies are being presented by people entering the workforce?  What is the nature of the gap between competencies needed and competencies being offered? What are some means for closing the ""gap?"" Engineers, managers, and educators are expected to benefit from the exploration of the questions being posed.  The ASEM organization, too, may find a particular role to play in helping to provide appropriate solutions to the workforce preparation.",
86,Development of an Instrument to Understand Nurse-Physician Relationships ,,,"US healthcare faces a variety of complex challenges as pressure builds to lower costs while simultaneously improving care quality. These challenges have drawn many researchers seeking ways to improve healthcare delivery. Two key issues commonly identified in these efforts are: 1) The need to reduce adverse patient outcomes caused by medical errors, and 2) The need to reduce staffing shortages that lead to lower levels of direct patient interaction. Several studies have shown that disruptive behavior, especially within nurse-physician interactions, can be a material contributor to both of these issues because they can lead to turnover and create additional stress and cognitive loading for those who remain. While researchers have investigated the nature of nurse-physician interaction, these studies tend to focus on the perception of nurses and not physicians.  In addition, studies generally do not investigate the underlying culture that supports these behaviors.  Social Norms Theory (SNT) presents a novel approach to investigate behavioral norms in the healthcare workplace.  SNT suggests that people tend to behave in the way they believe is most typical of and accepted by their peers. Unfortunately, perceptions of behaviors are frequently inaccurate, with views of problematic behaviors overestimated and healthy behaviors underestimated. This disconnect may lead individuals to believe that disruptive behavior is an acceptable norm, when the true norms disagree. This study leveraged SNT as a means to address both gaps by developing a new survey instrument that involves both nurses and physicians to measure norms.  This paper discusses the development and validation of the instrument.",
87,Analytic Hierarchy Approach to Inland Waterway Cargo Prioritization and Terminal Allocation ,,,"The cargo prioritization terminal allocation problem (CPTAP) applied to inland waterway disruptions studies the integrated assignment and scheduling problem of disrupted barges to terminals, where the cargo is offloaded to be transported by an alternative transportation mode, with the aim of minimizing the total value loss. We propose a solution approach that divides the problem into two components: assignment of the disrupted barges to the terminals and scheduling of the barges assigned to each particular terminal. Both components use a priority index associated to each type of cargo, which is obtained from an Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) approach. The first component is tackled by solving a sequence of assignment problems using an integer programming (IP) model that minimizes transportation and handling time. The second component of the decision, offloading scheduling of the barges at each terminal, is addressed by using the priority indexes obtained with AHP. The higher the priority index of a barges cargo, the earlier the barge will be scheduled for offloading. The proposed solution approach is easier to implement compared with previous work based on a non-linear approach. A case example is presented to illustrate our results.",
88,Value-Focused Assessment of Cargo Value Decreasing Rates,,,"Transportation is an essential component of any economy, and cargo disruptions can have substantial economic and societal impacts. These damaging consequences can be mitigated through quantitative assessment and prioritization of disrupted cargo such that the critical cargo is redirected intelligently. We have developed a cargo prioritization and terminal allocation decision model that minimizes the total value loss of cargo disruptions. The model results in a substantially lower total value loss when compared to a naïve minimize distance approach. Since the value decreasing rate is a critical component of such models, there is a need for a robust methodology to comprehensively assess the value decreasing rate of disrupted cargo in support of efficient and effective disruption response. The talk will present a value-focused thinking (VFT) approach to develop a cargo value decreasing rate (CVDR), the rate at which the economic and societal value of cargo diminishes as time elapses. An example based on barge cargos transported on the inland waterways is incorporated to exemplify the developed methodology. This VFT approach contributes a rigorous method for CVDR assessment, which in turn contributes to better quality cargo prioritization models.",
89,Smart Measures: An Alternative Approach to Prioritizing Performance Measurements for Business Consultants based on Organizational Design ,,,"The intent of this research is to explore the autonomy of performance measures using a system of systems thinking perspective within the Business Management Consultant community, whereas the characteristics of an Organizations design and its prioritization preference of measures are used to assess overall performance and suggest whether the prioritization of a measure should change to realize improved performance.  This phenomenon would suggest that there is a set of relevant performance measurement priorities based on the characteristics of the organizations design that can be used to realize strategic goals empirically.  Although there are several elements used to assess the characteristics of Organizational Design this research will only focus on culture and leadership style. The classification of culture and leadership style will be determined by the Decision Maker(s) in the form of a survey.  Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) is used to determine organizational culture. Multi-Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5x is used to determine leadership style. Pairwise comparison will be used to determine the Decision Maker(s) weighting preference of measures. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping is a tool commonly used to represent system behavior and will be used in this study to assess the overall performance. This research posits that the weighted relevance of performance measures is highly correlated to the characteristics of the organizations design and that smart measures will evolve with the ability to indicate when a change in the prioritization of measures is needed through the use of the Hebbians learning algorithm. This approach introduces the concept of smart measures. ",
90,Learning Organization Characteristics in Deployed Military Units ,,,"In order to be successful, research suggests that organizations must be able to adapt to their environment. One approach for achieving this is for an organization to become what is called a Learning Organization. The approach, and underlying theory, has been adapted to different organizational settings, but while the characteristics of Learning Organizations have been studied in many areas, there have been relatively few studies on these characteristics in the context of the military. More specifically, there has been little effort to investigate whether deployed military units function as Learning Organizations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of a Learning Organization in this context and to consider the impact of these characteristics and leadership style on mission success. To pilot test the approach for the larger study, a series of interviews and three focus groups were conducted with members of the Belgian Armed Forces who had recently participated in one or more deployed missions. In addition, each participant was also asked to complete a questionnaire adapted from the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ). The results and implications are discussed and a basic framework of these relationships is proposed.",
91,Key Factors Driving Personnel Downsizing In Multinational Military Organizations ,,,"Although downsizing has long been a topic of research in traditional organizations, there are very few studies of this phenomenon in military contexts. As a result, we have little understanding of the key factors that drive personnel downsizing in military setting. This study contributes to our understanding of key factors that drive personnel downsizing in military organizations and whether those factors may differ across NATO nations cultural clusters. The theoretical framework for this study was built from studies in non-military contexts and adapted to fit the military environment. This research relies on historical data from one of the largest multinational coalition forces worldwide. Time series cross-sectional dynamic panel data from 28 NATO countries over 23 years (1990-2012) were gathered. A series of analyses by using Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) one-step difference method with robust standard errors were conducted in two steps. For the first step, an inspection of the key factors that drive personnel downsizing was analyzed by using Stata xtabond estimation. For the second step, an analysis of whether or not the key factors differ across NATO nations cultural clusters was conducted. The findings from this research contribute to the discipline of engineering management by providing a model to improve our understanding and ability to predict future personnel downsizing decisions and to increase our understanding of military governance not only NATO wide but also worldwide. Differences found across cultural clusters make this study more noteworthy.",
92,Game-Based Simulation in Urban Planning Decision-Making,,,"Climate change has influenced many municipalities to think holistically about the status of their infrastructure, the resulting living environment and the life-style of their residents. However, climate change is not the only factor; future expansion and improvements are also critical. Thus, municipalities have started planning and acting accordingly to solve or mitigate any potential impact from climate change and other possible challenges on their residents and infrastructure. Understanding the current situation of the infrastructure and residents satisfaction have become pivotal as well. After many studies, modern municipalities have found that their actions directly affect residents welfare, health and safety. Thus, they put great attention on the decision-making process and created panels that include residents, experts, institutions, and governmental agencies to plan and decide their future city ambiance. By increasing safety and providing a healthy environment, cities will boost their current residents satisfaction, and have the potential of gaining more residents and expanding. Considering all of these aspects means that cities are going to develop and grow rapidly and consequently their income will increase in various ways. To understand the importance of these actions and consequences, this study utilizes the SimCity4 game as a simulation tool. Included in the analysis are the impact of utilities, safety and security elements, waste management, transportation, and urban planning. The SimCitys major metrics, population and residents satisfaction along with tax income and the citys capital were observed in determining how the decision-making process influenced the city's performance.",
93,Managing Stakeholder Satisfaction through Optimization for Sustainability in Higher Education: A Challenging Process,,,"Building sustainable universities calls for participation in management, requiring collaboration and cooperation with stakeholders who usually have competing objectives. Combining analytic hierarchy/network processes (AHP/ANP) with statistical analysis and mathematical modeling, this research proposes a framework that can be used by decision makers in higher education for integrating stakeholder preferences into strategic decisions. The proposed framework is applied to a private university in Turkey as a case study through a survey of 30 participants, representing key internal stakeholder groups  graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, administrative staff, and top management. The survey demonstrates stakeholders priorities with respect to sustainability performance indicators and a set of investment projects, as well as how they change under low, medium and high financial constraints. The present research extends literature both methodologically and in scope. First, it adds a statistical analysis component involving a diverse sample of stakeholders, while previous applications of AHP/ANP in higher education involve a single or a few decision makers. Then, based on the collected data, it also proposes various types of mathematical models including stochastic, integer and nonlinear ones to optimize the satisfaction levels of different stakeholder groups.",
94,The Big Five Questions: Strategy Simplified ,,,"Owners and senior executives in smaller companies, and startup companies especially, often struggle to ask the proper questions and collect reasonable information that will help them gain competive advantage in the marketplace.  In an increasing competitive marketplace, corporate leaders must not only have great products (or services), but also have strong focus on key matters that will help them become (and remain) highly competitive.  This paper draws upon considerable experience of the author in working with these issues.  The overall strategic analysis methodology is not explored, although it is discussed, briefly.  Rather, there are actions and questions presented in terms of ""The Big Five Questions"" that have proved to be extremely useful to many company owners and senior managers in companies, both large (revenues in excess of $1 billion) and small. Any individual currently leading an organization, or planning to be in a leadership role, is expected to benefit from this paper. Both practicioners of management, and students of management and engineering, should benefit from the ideas and suggestions.",
95,A Hybrid Approach of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set Theory and DEMATEL Method to Prioritize Selection Criteria of Bank Branches Locations ,,,"Optimally locating new bank branches is a strategic decision in banking industry in order to stay competitive. The importance of this issue is primarily due to the fact that locating branches in appropriate sites is one of the main factors in absorbing and satisfying bank customers. This results in a core benefit for banks, particularly in a vibrant competition. In addition, without a set of well-chosen selection criteria and their prominence, the goal of locating suitable sites for bank branches would not be efficiently achieved. In this research, six most widely used criteria for bank branch location consideration are obtained from the literature review. These criteria include demographic attributes, access to public facilities, transportation, competition, cost and flexibility. In order to prioritize these criteria, an integrated methodology of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory as well as Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) technique (i.e. IFDEMATEL) are utilized. The DEMATEL technique considers interrelationships between criteria. Furthermore, the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory, which has some advantages over fuzzy set theory, to include the vagueness and imprecision of subjective judgments of specialists is applied. As a case study, a well-known Iranian public bank in the city of Rasht, Iran is considered. Consequently, the obtained ranks from the integrated method provide useful information for bank managers in determining efficient locations of their new branches.",
96,A SERVQUAL Model Approach Integrated with Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS Methodologies to Rank Insurance Firms ,,,"Ranking life insurance firms, particularly regarding customer-oriented criteria, has become a significant research priority of many insurance research centers. This is mainly due to the effective role of life insurance in improving the capital market and the role of service quality in customer satisfaction. This issue has remained one of the major topics associated with insurance industry which has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This study aims at prioritizing insurance firms which hold the majority proportion of Iran's total life insurance market. Life insurers are assessed and ranked with regard to 5 criteria of customer service quality in the SERVQUAL model as well as opinions of 43 qualified insurance brokers in Tehran, Iran. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is utilized to determine the importance weight of each criterion of the SERVQUAL (service quality) model. After which, the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) is applied in order to rank the firms. Both Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods are conducted in the fuzzy environment to handle the uncertainty and impreciseness of one's subjective judgments. The results revealed the ranking of 13 Iranian insurance companies in the context of life insurance.",
97,Fuzzy Logic Applications in Supply Chain Performance Measurement ,,,"Supply chain, undoubtedly, is an area of wide research and application. It apparently is an incredible network, which comes in to existence with the formation of every organization and, becomes automatically complex as the organization progresses. There are many aspects in supply chain that interest researchers, out of which, development of a supply chain performance measurement method, is having a lot of avenues still left to explore. Fuzzy logic techniques, on the other hand, has wide applications across many fields and, is known to be one of the best means for dealing with uncertainty issues found in data sets. This study is aimed at exploring instances where fuzzy logic technique has been applied to measure supply chain performance. It outlines major research outputs and provides a discussion on a possible venture that bears promise of a combination of fuzzy logic technique with a genetic algorithm for better supply chain performance measurement results. The findings are anticipated to be of value for academia working on supply chain performance measurement, who are particularly looking at improving the accuracy of results.",
98,Curriculum Topics in Non-ABET Accredited Engineering Management Programs ,,,"The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) database on engineering programs and graduates indicates there are 23 programs in the United States classifying themselves as engineering management (EM).  Of these 23 programs, only five are ABET accredited EM programs.  Additionally, there are six ABET accredited EM programs not listed in the ASEE database.  Overall, there are only 11 ABET accredited EM programs on a national basis (programs with management in the name).  It is unclear why the majority of the ASEE EM programs do not pursue ABET accreditation.  Possible explanations may involve curriculum which does not contain sufficient engineering content and thus may not be able to be ABET accredited.    This paper explores this issue by analyzing these non- ABET EM programs and documenting the curricular content along with the stated program mission.  The paper examines the allocation of credits and explores whether these programs could be ABET accredited or whether the content potentially precludes this.  It generalizes the curricular approach employed by these programs to accomplish the program mission.  The results will inform program planners who may be considering EM programs and ABET accreditation.  ",
99,Results of a Role Delineation Study for the AEM and PEM Certification Exam ,,,A role delineation study was conducted to validate the competency areas for the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) and the Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification examinations offered by the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM). The study was conducted using a single stage web based survey. The survey subjects were asked demographic questions followed by likert type questions to rate the sub domains of Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBOK). Parallel questions to include the topics on the AEM and PEM certification exams were also asked on a dichotomous scale. The survey also asked the participants to choose if it was necessary to include each of the sub domains in the exams. The competency areas were categorized based on the mean and standard deviation of the ratings. An exam blueprint was obtained for the certification exams and the competency areas in the EMBOK were also validated through the study. Detailed results of the study will be discussed in this paper.,
100,A Conceptual Methodology to Create a Feasible and Effective Program Organization Design ,,,"The complexity of program organizations that handle the development of complex products increases the challenge of delivering such complex products in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Current organizational design methods have not focused on organizations that have the purpose of designing and developing large systems or products. An architecture framework for designing program organizations has been proposed in previous work. However, the proposed framework does not indicate whether such a design is feasible or effective. This paper presents a conceptual methodology for creating a feasible and effective program organization whose purpose is to design and develop complex products. The methodology starts by utilizing Program Organization Architecture Framework (POAF) to construct a description of a program organization that meets the program requirements and constraints. Then, the organizational description is formulated as a constraint programming model with the aim of finding a feasible solution. The concept of systems thinking and systems engineering models are adapted to address the dynamics associated with the design of a program organization that is responsive to changing environments. The program organization design problem is organized and captured as a SysML models and extended to the POAF model libraries where it can be quickly reused and modified. This approach builds on the existing POAF to aid the program managers to support the decision-making process of implementing an effective program organization design during the design and development process.

101,A Model for the Integration of Activity Theory and Sociotechnical System Theory,,,"In evaluating previous activity theory (AT) and sociotechnical systems theory (STS) research, conceptual linkages can be made between the constructs and usage of the frameworks. An example linkage is the similarity between ATs mediating artifacts and STSs consideration of the technological subsystem within an overall work system, as both can be conceptualized as tangible items that influence task completion and goal accomplishment (Engeström, 1987; Hendrick & Kleiner, 2001). The current literature, however, reveals no existing models that fully attempt to integrate AT and STS into a single, refined framework for work system assessment and design. While some researchers have used activity theory in the context of sociotechnical systems, they do not attempt to integrate the two frameworks into a unified framework for analysis, design, and change research. After describing and providing relevant examples of each theoretical lens, this paper posits an integrated conceptual AT-STS model and discusses the affordances of integrating the two theoretical lenses. Importantly, this work explains how an integrated AT-STS model could enhance engineering systems analysis, work system design, and change research.",
102,Scaling Technology-Intensive Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Emerging Economies into Agile High-Performing Organizations: Validating Human Factors as Success Determinants,,,"In rapidly changing and highly competitive business environments, companies constantly search for new ways to improve performance and gain competitive advantage. Over the years, studies have examined the intersection of leadership strategies and organization structures in relation to company performance. These studies have revealed theoretical frameworks for organizational learning in various life cycle stages of technology-intensive enterprises. However, organizational inefficiencies have continued to challenge the growth and development of technology-intensive start-up companies in emerging economies. Studies on strategic management of these inefficiencies lean towards knowledge management systems and theoretically underpin human factors. It is, therefore, imperative for technology leaders and managers to establish frameworks for tracking and evaluating human factors that promote the success of technology-intensive start-ups in emerging markets. This research aims to explore Information and Communication Technology (ICT) start-ups in East Africa using a sample of 150 small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Human factors will be evaluated based on surveys in an effort to empirically validate success determinants of these enterprises. Research findings will be incorporated into growth models that will aid executives in understanding and structuring frameworks for ensuring agility and success in emerging economies.",
103,The Protection of Valuable Tacit Knowledge in a Learning Alliance; an Interorganizational Learning Case Study. ,,,"~~A case of interorganizational learning is examined where the protection of tacit knowledge transfer is critical. The case demonstrates that interorganizational tacit knowledge transfer depends upon interorganizational personnel transfers, learning-firm gatekeepers, close interaction among teaching-firm personnel and learning-firm gatekeepers, and interpersonal trust among interacting participants. A literature review identifies the theoretical framework and key concepts.  A presented case illustrates these key concepts.  Emergent concepts are identified through case incidents. The literature identifies interpersonal trust as a key mediator of knowledge transfer and contractual agreements as a weak moderator of trust.  This presents upper management with the dilemma of how to participate in learning alliances and still protect a subset of the firms knowledge from inadvertent transfer.  A case is examined where the negotiation of a third-party contractual agreement by working-level personnel produced a strong moderating effect on the ability of personal interactions to inadvertently transfer knowledge.  This leads to the emergent construct that sensitizing working-level personnel, perhaps by participation in the negotiation of agreements, exerts a strong influence on the protection of valuable subsets of knowledge in a learning alliance. The extant literature leads us to expect complete transfer of tacit knowledge based on the actions of both firms in this case study.  However, the outcome was not complete transfer but the protection of specified valuable knowledge in the face of significant interpersonal pressure.  The unanticipated outcome indicates that the effect of sensitizing working-level personnel to the protection of specific knowledge in a learning alliance needs further examination.",
104,Spinning-out University Technologies: A Role for Students in the Commercialization Process ,,,"Universities engage in technology commercialization with many different motivations including the goal of accomplishing sustainable innovation with economic and societal impact and diversifying income streams. Compared to licensing, spinning out new companies create advantages both for the university and the academic inventor, as equity holders, which act as incentives to increase spin-outs. Some universities are much better at spinning out companies, although the evidence suggests that universities generally struggle to successfully commercialize research results as new firms which make creating more spin-outs based on research results a priority among stakeholders. Prior research has identified universities policies, intellectual eminence and commercially-oriented research as factors that impact the spinning out of new companies (Di Gregorio & Shane 2003). The role of the technology transfer unit in providing access to resources and support services has also been identified as influencing spin-out activities (Van Burg et al., 2008; Jain & George, 2007).   The research however, has not explored the role that students might have in the technology commercialization process. This study focuses on this under-researched area to investigate how university students might influence the commercialization of university assigned intellectual property, specifically how students working for university credits can help the spin-out process. It is based in the context of the Photonics Engineering department of a technical university.  This setting provides a unique opportunity to explore how students working to fulfil an academic requirement can create momentum around a technology to influence its spinout potential.  ",
105,Development of A Tool to Evaluate Innovation Practices and Entrepreneurship in an International Context ,,,"Entrepreneurship is considered as important value adding tool for the entire economy. In fact, entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as national assets to be cultivated and motivated to the greatest possible extent. In todays global economy, exciting opportunities for cross border trade exist like never before. As a result of this, international entrepreneurship and innovation have come to the forefront of discussions in recent times. International entrepreneurship can be defined as the process of an entrepreneur conducting business activities across national boundaries. Alternatively, it can also be defined as, a combination of innovative, proactive and risk seeking behavior that crosses national borders and is intended to create value within organizations. For international entrepreneurship, there are a slew of factors that have to be taken into consideration such as economics, type of economic system, political-legal environment, culture, acceptance to risk etc. In addition to understanding entrepreneurship in other countries, it is important for local entrepreneurs to understand the kinds of practices that lead to innovations in other countries. In this paper, the co-authors will develop a tool to evaluate the innovation practices and entrepreneurship efforts being done in the US as well as in other countries. The countries that will be evaluated using this tool will be The United States, Canada, Germany, Austria, India, Finland, Poland, Bulgaria, China and Japan. The tool developed will be a survey to capture practices and qualities of entrepreneurs in those countries at various stages of the entrepreneurial lifecycle.",
106,Ancillary Benefits of Maritime Transportation,,,"Maritime transportation connects the United States (U.S.) to economies around the world by providing the most fuel efficient and environmental friendly mode of freight transportation. More than thirteen million jobs are generated annually by activities that are related to the U.S. maritime transportation system which is comprised of intermodal connections and marine terminals. The navigable inland waterways are an essential component of the U.S. maritime transportation system. More than twenty-five thousand miles of navigable inland waterways serve as a cost effective transportation option for a wide array of freight supply chains. In addition to providing economic benefits, the inland waterway system has ancillary benefits including water supply, tourism and recreation, flood prevention, power generation, and endangered species protection. To understand and value the ancillary benefits of the U.S. inland waterway transportation system, we conducted a thorough literature review to better understand these benefits and existing evaluation techniques. We will demonstrate our findings through an illustrative case study of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System. ",
107,Application Desirability Function for Automotive Paint Thickness ,,,"In automotive painting processes, one of the quality characteristics observed is the thickness of the paint. It is so important that for one vehicle there are at least 57 points to review. The problem arises when decisions should be made in order to define if the vehicle paint has achieved the quality expected or not. When a quality indicator lays on multiple responses, it becomes devious to analysis and techniques are required to manage this complexity. The desirability function is a technique used to convert multiple response indicators into one metric. It allows each indicator to have their own scale and goal, transforming them into a global one (D) using a standard scale (0 to 1). The implementation and effectiveness of this approach are going to be discussed in this paper with a numerical and practical example.",
108,Modeling Military Supply Chains,,,"United States military operations conducted over the past few decades have primarily been supplied through Sea Ports of Debarkation (SPODs) and Aerial Ports of Debarkation (APODs). In recent theaters of operations, the United States has had the advantage of friendly ports and airfields.  The purpose of this project is to build a validated model of APODs and SPODs within the military logistics systems in an operational theater in order to inform decisions makers on a more resilient and optimized supply chain.  The model will be used by Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC). The analysis will allow ERDC to build on top of a validated model, and provide insights to future alternatives to APODs and SPODs.  ERDC is the main stakeholder for this project who wants these models in order to incorporate them into a larger model of the logistics system.",
109,Systems Engineering and Project Management: Why Cant We All Get Along?,,,"The importance of the integration between project management and systems engineering has been discussed in several works. However, unproductive tension between project / program managers and the chief systems engineer / systems engineers continues to be an impediment to project / program performance. In a recent study, Rebentisch and Conforto (2014) found that about three out of ten respondents indicated that there is some (26%) or significant (3%) unproductive tension between program managers and systems engineers. They found that the lack of Integrated Planning is a key source of Unproductive Tension (57%). Also contributing to tension between the roles are not having clearly defined authority (44%) and conflicting practices between the two roles (41%). They looked for the causal links and proposed several questions for future research, including how to better combine standards from both disciplines to improve integration, and whether integration is adequately addressed by current project management and systems engineering curricula. We address relevant causes of unproductive tensions and describe the active coordination between two new curricula: an M.S. in project management and an M.S. in systems engineering, to highlight processes, standards, organizational, and human factors, and institute effective integration between the two disciplines with the objective of improving project and program performance.",
110,Bibliometric Analysis of Author Collaboration in Engineering Management Research ,,,"While many researchers would agree that the engineering management research field has been increasing in maturity since its inception due to the significant body of work published on various aspects of engineering management, this evolution has not been empirically established. The purpose of this preliminary work is to assess the development of this field by evaluating the anatomy of authorship in the field. It has been argued that examining papers published within an academic journal can provide useful information about the evolution of the underlying field. Thus, using the Engineering Management Journal (EMJ) to represent the engineering management field, bibliometric analyses are applied to the 227 papers published in the most recent ten years in the journal. Questions addressed about the field include: Who is studying these topics? To what extent are there communities of authors collaborating in research groups? How internationalized has engineering management become with respect to author location? How multi-disciplinary has the field become? These analyses will provide insight into how the field is evolving and possible future directions. This work represents the first phase of this research and the evaluation of EMJ will be extended in future work to include evaluation of other questions related to the content and research methodologies employed by papers published in EMJ.

111,Review of Performance Measurement Practices in Military and Government Sectors,,,"Performance measurement systems are being used more often across a wider range of organizational settings, which has led to a divergence in the practices and frameworks being used. One area that has been of particular interest in recent years is the public sector. A preliminary review of the literature suggests that there is a strong emphasis of research in this area but that there is little consensus concerning the metrics and frameworks used in different areas. In addition, there appears to be a significant amount of research being conducted on the government sector while focus on the military sector seems to be much lower. This study focuses on identifying the characteristics of performance measurement systems studied and documented in government and military sectors including synthesizing any best practices or lessons learned identified in the literature to help support the design of PM systems in the military. This paper describes the development of the SLR methodology and the results from review of the literature across six platforms.",
112,RBV Approach Improvement Through Enterprise Engineering Recommendations ,,,"The Resource Based View (RBV) is a strategic perspective to comprehend an organizations competitive advantages through its resources and competences. However, the RBV approach is not sufficient to deal with the dynamic requirements an enterprise must face while operating in a complex environment. This paper adapts the RBV approach based on the Cambridge process approach and proposed in the book Competing through competences, by J. Mills, K. Platts, M. Bourne and A. Neely. This book describes how businesses can improve their competitive position and sustainability by adopting a competence based approach, proposing actions based on specific procedures that focus on process practices. The analysis is carried out by considering the alignment of objectives and procedures of steps that form the RBV approach to a set of Enterprise Engineering (EE) guidelines, which could inform and determine how well-structured this approach is regarding its processes. The study reveals that there are some gaps in the RBV approach regarding EE guidelines and suggests improvements to fill these gaps. Aspects covered in this analysis are process formalization, organizational structure, process synchronization, explicit considerations of performance expectations, exceptions handling, and incorporation of embedded mechanisms for change and improvement. The paper extends and shows the relevance of each EE guideline for the RBV approach. Lastly, it represents an advance in the strategic management of operations by proposing a reviewed RBV approach through EE guidelines. ",
113,An Examination of Data Collection Instruments for Measuring Emotional Intelligence and Organizational Commitment ,,,"Emotional Intelligence and Organizational Commitment have been theorized to be positively related to Job Performance.  Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to how well an individual monitors not only his or her own emotions but also those of others, identifies them, and is able to organize and choose actions based upon them. Organizational Commitment (OC) refers to an individuals emotional and practical reasons for remaining with an employer as well as a sense of innate loyalty to the employer.  The literature has documented mixed findings that support such a relationship.  One factor contributing to the lack of consensus in the literature is due to the vast number of instruments available to measure these constructs, particularly EI.  This paper will contrast and compare the various data collection instruments published in the literature used to measure EI and OC.  Factors to be examined include theory/model alignment, rater (self or other), number of questions, length of time to complete, sample type measured, validity, and reliability.  This consolidated summary will be useful to future researchers by assisting in the selection of data collection instruments.  Understanding which instruments might be more appropriate for measuring EI and OC in engineering organizations and utilizing this knowledge to enable more effective leadership and more committed employees would contribute to the field of Engineering Management.",
114,Performance Measurement Systems in Nonprofit Organizations: a Systematic Literature Review ,,,"Performance measurement constitutes a vital organizational function. It assures strategies realization, provides actions accountability to organizations stakeholders, and engages everyone in sustainable processes for operations continuous improvement. There is a vast literature on performance measurement systems (PMS) regarding frameworks, concepts, indicators, processes and technologies, usually associated with organizations from the manufacturing and services industries. Nevertheless, the application of PMS to nonprofit organizations has gained interest from both researchers and practitioners communities in recent years. Nonprofit organizations have their own dynamic for dealing with different requirements for performance measurement associated with each of their stakeholders. They have complex, interface-rich processes that interact with the environment based on legislation, policies, pacts and agendas. Taking this into account, the nature of a PMS for this type of organization must be better explored. This work is the first part of a long-term research project focusing on the development of a PMS framework for nonprofit organizations. It provides a systematic literature review of published works that focus on PMS in nonprofit organizations. It aims at establishing, from the literature viewpoint, the main indicators, processes, frameworks, concepts and applied technologies. It discusses these elements and provides a tentative framework for research and application of PMS in these organizations.",
115,On the Combined use of Akaike Information Criterion and Logistic Regression to Quantify Success for System Operation ,,,"Complex systems have interoperability limits that constrain their successful operation. Quantifiably understanding these limitations provides the practitioner with a useful screening tool to establish regions of feasible system-level operation within which to perform design, analysis, and/or optimization operations. This study presents the combined use of logistic regression to screen successful conditions of operation along with Akaikes Corrected Information Criterion to quantify which proposed model and which factors likely influence successful operation.  Three disparate types of factors are considered that emulate a continuous variable such as pressure, a discrete variable such as level of fluid in a tank, and a categorical variable such as type of pump. The response is binary in nature, with success and failure as the two modes of response. Twenty five models of the response are considered that involve all possible combinations of the factors and their interactions up to level three. The metrics of Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence and corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) are compared in terms of model selection.  It is determined that AICc metric favors the nearly-simplest model whilst the KL metric favors the most complex model.  The levels of quality in prediction are also superior when employing the AICc metric relative to the KL metric.  It is therefore determined that discrimination of success can be established with AICc with fewer data points as well as a simpler model.  The implication is that systems state as well as success or failure may be more readily established with less data (i.e. fewer sensors).",
116,A Cladistics Co-evolution Model for Products and Manufacturing Systems ,,,"The changes in manufacturing systems are reciprocal, in which a product design change would trigger a new demand for a manufacturing capability, and a newly introduced manufacturing capability would allow for a new product design feature to be introduced. Relating changes in both sides would result in a co-evolution model that reveals change trend of product features vs. manufacturing capabilities and how they are associated. Changes in product design can be tracked by hierarchical clustering of different product variants. However, most of those techniques are based on similarity, which cannot suggest informative change directions or future modifications. On the manufacturing capabilities side, clustering is performed in association with the existing part families to produce manufacturing cells. However clustering manufacturing capabilities themselves is not a common practice in literature, though it might reveal the direction of progression for those capabilities and hence their future trend. Cladistics is a hierarchical clustering technique that is used mainly in biology to produce evolution hypotheses. It is based on parsimony rather than similarity. This means the physical product features and system capabilities can be presented side by side on the same clustering scheme. While cladistics has been used to cluster product variants or system manufacturing capabilities separately, this paper represents a novel approach that applies the technique to both sides simultaneously. The result is a single clustering tree that carries both product features and manufacturing capabilities. Each branch of the tree does not only represent common features or capabilities but also correspondence between the existing",
117,Research Agenda into Human-Intelligence/Machine-Intelligence Governance ,,,"Since the birth of modern artificial intelligence (AI) at the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, the AI community has pursued modeling and coding of human intelligence into AI reasoning processes (HI-MI).  The Dartmouth Conferences fundamental assertion was that every aspect of human learning and intelligence could be so precisely described that it could be simulated in AI.  With the exception of knowledge specific areas (such as IBMs Big Blue and a few others), sixty years later the AI community is not close to coding global human intelligence into AI.  In parallel, the knowledge management community has pursued understanding of organizational knowledge creation, transfer, and management (HI-HI) over the last 40 years.  Knowledge management evolved into an organized discipline in the early 1990s through formal university courses and creation of the first chief knowledge officer organizational positions.  Correspondingly, over the last 25 years there has been growing research into the transfer of intelligence and cooperation among computing systems and automated machines (MI-MI).  In stark contrast to the AI community effort, there has been little research into transferring AI knowledge and machine intelligence into human intelligence (MI-HI) with a goal of improving human decision making.  Most important, there has been no research into human-intelligence/machine-intelligence governance; that is, the policies and processes governing human-machine decision making toward systemic mission accomplishment.  To address this gap, this paper sets forth a research agenda and framework toward developing an HI-MI governance body of knowledge and discipline.",

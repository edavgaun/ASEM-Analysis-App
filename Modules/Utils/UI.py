    ### ðŸ§­ How to Use This App

    This tool lets you explore over 10 years of ASEM conference papers in a 2D space generated using UMAP and LLM-based embeddings.

    - **Filter** by year and topic to narrow down the dataset.
    - Each dot represents a paper. Similar papers appear closer together.
    - **Year Centroids** are shown to help you visualize semantic drift (vertical dashed lines).
    - Hover over points (in Plotly) to see details and explore relationships between topics and years.

    This interface supports meta-analysis, comparative research, and exploration of thematic trends in Engineering Management discussions.
